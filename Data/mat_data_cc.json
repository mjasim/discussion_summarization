I've seen several dog fights and attacks recently. Additionally, just a simple walk tot he grocery store is nerve wracking, due to motor traffic everywhere at high speeds. My suggestion is that high rise parking be built on one block where the freeways empty into downtown and people be required to park there and take shuttles into the city center. (Very common in most European cities). The emptied streets could then be planted up with green islands that people could actually use to walk, sit in, socialize, and some could be turned in dog runs.
