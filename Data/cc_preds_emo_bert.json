grocery store is nerve wracking due to motor traffic everywhere at high speeds my suggestion is that high rise parking be built on one block where the freeways empty into downtown and people be required to park there and take shuttles into the city center very common in most european cities the emptied streets could then be planted up with green islands that people could actually use to walk

attractive to walk on a clean street and not have to step over a human sleeping in a nook","emotion":"excited"},{"comment":"agree with dennis most of these look like another place for the homeless to camp out bathe the fountain or panhandle look at the library","emotion":"neutral"},{"comment":"i couldnt agree more its totally disgusting that our beautiful new library is another homeless camp who would bring their children to a library if they have to walk through the homeless camp to do it","emotion":"anger"},{"comment":"i dont have a problem with the name el nudillo but it should be polled

transport","emotion":"concern"},{"comment":"occasional street closures for markets and craft fairs other events would encourage and facilitate residents and visitors getting around on foot by bicycle

neighborhoods the weekly market is a great idea and requires creating a large plaza area where this can be set up it could also serve as an outdoor performance area for locally based musicians performers and artists ongoing activities at this plaza would be required to keep it activated and of interest to the diverse population of the area maybe a private industry promoter could be hired for this and also take over responsibility for activating horton plaza park which westfield has failed at","emotion":"excited"},{"comment":"historical murals on the
