plastic straws cups when paper ones work plastic bags is another issue but in many cases are necessary however paper bags do work foam packaging should be banned as cardboard protection works just

buy mixed greens these days is in a clamshell plastic container supermarkets need to be regulated so they must offer such items in bulk so a consumer can use a reusable vegetable bag to put the the

longer\n2 governments ban the use of plastic straws plastic cotton swabs plastic bags plastic cutlery and other consumer single use items governments have a huge influence over industries that create these items and need to lead the way on influencing peoples habits and ideas if we are going to tackle this problem governments can also set standards for industry about how much packaging they use and the types of plastic used ie recyclable or biodegradable this could be particularly effective for single use coffee cups it may be unrealistic to ban them entirely but making them mandatory to be biodegradable can reduce their lifetime in landfills\nindividuals stop using single use items whenever possible period this includes straws cutlery coffee cups plastic swabs stir sticks there are reusable options for all of these items i entirely understand that sometimes these items must be used people lead busy lives and can forget to bring along those items but if we work to integrate using with these reusable items into our lives we will all be much better off\nindustries stop the use of excessive plastic packaging there are quality standards for packaging that need to be met for every

canadian superstore but if i dont have enough ill likely go straight to plastic bags since they dont have a cheap alternative safeway i always hit on the way from somewhere else so i never have reusable bags with me they do have paper bags as a free alternative but theyre thin handleless and genuinely impossible to carry so plastic bags it is but a final more local grocery store fresh st market carries thick handleable and free paper bags and while they still default to plastics the paper bags are kept in plain sight so at fresh st ill grab paper bags without a second thought\n2 i strongly agree with others sentiments about banning plastic bags as well as plastic straws once again other countries have done it successfully we only need to look to them to gain a solid foundation regular product packaging might be trickier to implement given the variety of companies and products but should nonetheless be feasible to use fresh st market in vancouver as a good example again they wrap their seafood in paper instead of plastic and that works out just fine some of their bakery products and the like also use paper packaging but unfortunately the vast majority of products are still plasticencased\nsomeone else in this discussion mentioned nada in vancouver which looks incredibly promising i would google that if you havent already heard of it if that becomes mainstream well have a good place to point and say see there are alternatives that work the distant hope is that government could then bring down their heavy hammer and say follow their example but i wouldnt wait too

stores such as donut franchises tim hortons or coffee shops starbucks and disposable to go cups it is unclear whether those coffee cup lids are recyclable or simply indicating that they were made from recycled materiel the cups themselves do not indicate that they can be recycled ultimately the reliance on onetime use plastics given their huge demand and consumption by customers must change business can be provided tax incentives or awarded a certain title by provincial and municipal governments for being environment conscious businesses can introduce reusable coffee mugscontainers to be purchased and eventually phase out disposable lids and cups those who require a disposable cup can be charged an additional fee eg $250 per purchase or pay a reduced fee for coffeetea when using reuse able containers it is hoped that changes in fees will entice businesses to be environmentally friendly as they make a marginal profit and customers purchasing behaviours will change to prevent paying extra fees for being environmentally unfriendly working with local governments domestic and foreign businesses that want to establish themselves in canada must meet certain standards and size criteria

bottle wasnt even half full or in an oversized blister pack this kind of thing is strictly for marketing purposes grabbing more shelf space and product visibilty excuses about labelling requirements and settling during modern manufacturing processes are weak at best there are such things as shakers and peel back labels or how about simply putting more product in the same container products often cost much less than the packaging\nanother example is shipped purchases a product wrapped in a plastic bag in protective packing material inside the retail box inside more protective packing material inside a much larger shipping box what a waste places like amazon are at least making a start with their frustrationfree packaging to save on shipping volume surcharges even though most products still start out in retail packaging that gets discarded by amazon hopefully responsibly recycled but still not overly green as online shopping increases even online grocery shopping more items can now be bulk packed right from the start by the manufacturer with minimal impact on marketing more items should also be manufactured for direct shipping in a padded envelope or plainish brown retail box with just a barcode label including brand product name model number in moderate sized font and a qrcode label for getting product information other printed information can be inside many items only need pictures and attention getting large labelling for the retail shelf\nperhaps also encourage shippers to charge more by volume and less be weight as long as their bottom line doesnt change what does it matter customs and the post office also gripe about sorting small padded envelopes maybe its time for new equipment\n2 my next biggest gripe unnecessary nonbiodegradable or nonrecyclable package liner materials\nas one example how often do you see plastic windows glued to the box and clear molded plastic or styrofoam product holders inside the box where a crude molded pulp paper liner egg carton with a picture on the box could be used the difference in materials manufacturing and shipping costs would be minimal if any again its more about marketing than manufacturing\nhow often do you see molded plastic product liners without a plastics code number and wonder what to do with it unidentified plastics either arent accepted for recycling or have to go into the low quality stream\n3 possible solutions we already have industry supported green certifications such as ocean wise certified organics forest stewardship council fairtrade even ecologo why not ecopack or some such no need for government regulation consumers need to shop their conscience conscientious retailers need to pressure the manufacturing industry to certify products retailers could even enhance their loyalty

business to bring your mug ive brought my mug before and places such as mcdonalds dont even make it any cheaper for you they pay for each individual cup and could save on operating costs if they didnt have to buy so many disposables all the time yet they still dont incentivize it incentivizing is a winwin for the consumer and the industry where is the policy that allows you to bring your own cup or own containers for food and give a mandatory price reduction at the minimum equivalent to the cost of the disposables that would otherwise be used disposables as a whole are just a completely unnecessary part of our society wasting time and effort making them and wasting resources and energy throwing them away or recycling them an outright ban on them should be put in place if they were banned people would start bringing their own the only reason they dont right now is because there is literally no reason not to unless you are environmentally conscious which not everybody is i find it absolutely disgraceful how a business like mc donalds or other fast food restaurants can carry some recyclable products such as the bags or coffee cups yet inside they have 0 recycling bins for this products only straight to the landfill why do they even bother making recyclable disposables and not even have bins for them there try going to a mcdonalds in saskatoon every one ive been to has no bin where is the legislation saying this is mandatory we keep talking about making change reducing waste and all but policy is lacking hugely time to follow other countries leads ban plastic bags

to me these types of foods have zero need to be wrapped in plastic seeing this in stores is very disheartening it means that i either have to buy the plasticwrapped food against my morals or not buy it look somewhere else since people will usually follow the easiest and most convenient option if the only option is plastic wrapped food they will buy it ive also seen plastic bags being offered or the need for them assumed in rather ridiculous situations for example when buying one small item at a store cashiers sometimes automatically put the item in a bag this is no fault of the cashier as they are likely instructed to bag the item unless the customer refuses it which i usually do or are so used to bagging items that this is a habit however some stores have now discontinued plastic bags

work on reducing the prevalence of plastic packaging and bags in stores if the option for plastic isnt right in front of our faces we will be less likely to use it and will adapt first up should be

health and environmental risks from plastic products as well as how long they will be usable for instance household appliances cell phone computers tvs etc should never be considered disposable and only have a short life span i still have my grandmothers kitchen mixer and radio that were purchased in the 1930s and they still work products today are designed to breakdown and be disposed of after a year or 2 water milk and beverage containers are another huge problem lets go back to glass or cardboard cartons i never buy eggs in plastic containers only in cardboard and i save those egg cartons for farmers in the area that sell eggs plastic shopping bags should be replaced with cloth or paper bags and diapers lets ban disposables and go back to reusable cloth think of how small a footprint

about the packaging of the product before i purchase it but i often think about it after the packaging has been removed\ni have learned that it is very difficult to recycle black plastic\nit is very

a consumer we only see it doing its job from store to home\nin the future i will consider the packagings use once it has served its purpose how can i reuse it in the home its ease of recyclability and its overall cost\n2 here is a list of suggestions that i think will make it easier to evaluate plastics as a packaging material\n educate the public on what the different plastics are how are they recycled why are they useful like cigarette packaging directly show the consequences of plastic waste on our local environment to consumers before they purchase a product\n find a way to disclose how much that packaging costs with respect to the cost of the product provide opportunities for consumers to make better buying decisions by creating a place for consumers to evaluate similar products with alternative packaging perhaps a database website or app\n provide incentives to the public for following through on wastereducing practices ie tax breaks for volunteering at local cleanup events\n directly involve plastics manufacturers and consumer product makers in the discussion so that feedback can be passed from consumers to producers\n provide incentives to businesses who package their products responsibly fiscal rewards tax exemptions etc","emotion":"anger"},{"comment":"an extra bin red color should be introduced for single use plastic bags etc along with other bins at local

sustainable in the longterm which can only mean a reduction in our dependency on singleuse plastics and plastics in general we can reuse a water bottle over and over but we know from recent studies that microplastics still enter the water that we end up consuming we can also extend the life of plastics only to have them discarded in inappropriate ways so again i believe the solution lies with reducing our dependency on plastics previous generations survived without so many plastic products but it did mean a shift in wastehabits and it does require an uncomfortable look at the fact that we

involved in large scale recycling programs i dont feel it is the solebest solution given consumer confusion fickle recycling markets and its potential to exhibit jevons paradox some might argue recycling increases resource consumption minimizing benefit important to point out necessity is connected to health and safety which is a place there are legitimate challenges to curbing single use

serviceware and vinyl signs ive also worked at event sites in the us that ban things like balloons straws and adhesive signs and have been required to put up a deposit to ensure we dont break these rules eg oregon convention centre city of sf plastic bag ban this works because the event or the venue have control over what comes into the event site our challenge is that others arent limited by the voluntary restrictions we place on our events and participants in them so it costs us more to manage waste and participants feel inconvenienced by the rules when they can have it easier elsewhere

lifestyle so i mostly purchase things in bulk where i can bring my own container if i absolutely have to purchase an item wrapped in plastic i always make sure it is recyclable in my area for instance 6 plastics arent so i always avoid those\n2 i strongly believe the responsibility of reducing plastics in our environment should fall onto the industries and government and not so much on the individual some things are simply not available plasticfree and at that point there is nothing an individual can do if they need this type of product accessibility to recycling is a huge factor some communities have different restrictions in regards to what can be recycled and what cant simply because of the available facilities not every community especially rural ones have the funds to access advanced recycling plants this limits us in the amount of materials we can recycle additionally many chains and retail stores have to pay for recycling themselves because the city or township does not pick up their recycling for instance i work in a pharmacy and the owner would have to spend additional money to have the recycling picked up so he doesnt to cut down on costs that means that all of the plastic vials used for medication are thrown in the trash and dont even have the opportunity to be recycled which is heartbreaking so the solution to this is making recycling accessible to everyone by aloting more funds to help cities townships and business owners to have access to recycling additionally recycling bins cost money in my township people have to pay to get a recycling bin sometimes with some extreme gusts of wind or during winter storms we lose our recycling bins they simply disappear from our curb side we shouldnt have to pay to get another recycling bin recycling should be accessible to everyone\n some countries have begun establishing laws against plastic straws i think canada should follow in those footsteps plastic straws are a huge waste and contribute a large amount of plastic found in our waters\n while recycling is great i strongly believe that eliminating the production of plastic to begin with is a far better option we need to invest in research to engineer new materials that can be used in similar ways but have little to no environmental impact and can also be recycled\n i would also love to see more and more businesses offering opportunities for individuals to bring back old containers lush is a good example they sell many things in the same types of containers and if you bring back 5 of those containers you get a free face mask the containers are already recyclable on their own but they offer an incentive for individuals to return the containers which helps them reduce on costs and materials they can reuse containers and not spend money on making new ones while businesses should already be inclined to do this because this allows them to cut on costs many businesses dont offer this type of service the reason behind this is unknown to me reducing costs should be enough incentive for companies to adopt this method\n i also think that incentives should be given to businesses who have lower carbon footprints in order to encourage companies to ditch plastics and waste\n i also want to stress that so many things are packaged in plastic for sanitary purposes there is absolutely no need to have fruits and vegetables wrapped in plastics if theyve already been washed by the producer and we then proceed to wash them at home plastic is absolutely unnecessary\n lastly one of the most important things is education taking the time to educate people about these issues is so important so many consumers are absolutely clueless that any of these issues are going on people know plastic is not good for the environment but they still go ahead and purchase it because its fine its recyclable reducing consumption is more important that investing in recycling people need to be made aware of the impacts plastics are having on the environment so consumers can make better decisions when they purchase items this could be drastic but adding some type of warning label on anything wrapped in plastic similar to warning labels on cigarette packs might get people to think twice about the things they purchase in the same train of though not enough people know how to recycle and compost properly too much time and money is spent triaging things at the recycling plant that should never have wound up there in the first place recycle bins and compost bins could contain graphics and images on them to offer a visual reprenstation of what goes in which bin residents who dont properly recycle and compost their products should also be fined the fines should be handed out by the person who picks up the

or grocery store chain for proper sanitation this eliminates the sanitary issues associated with people bringing their own containers and this way families dont need to keep track get confused with their recycling places that accept containers for sanitation need to be welldistributed to make things convenient for the customers and it could be profitable and feasible by buying in to the program as a sort of rental concept with a larger upfront cost that acts as a deposit if containers are not returned\nthere should also be a government mandate that all plastics should be recyclable or that

alternatives for instance if i need tomatoes i consider whether my local grocery store sells tomatoes that are not packaged in plastic and i choose those 2 what can governments individual or industries do\n i really think we need to take the burden off individuals to address plastics waste i know it is politically palatable to encourage individuals to take action on their own and write to their local retailers about reducing plastic packaging etc but i am not convinced there are enough willing individuals to make a real difference in this issue excessive plastics use and waste has been a problem for nearly four decades and individual action has made littletono impact\n even as an ecoconscious individual there are so many larger factors out of my control that affect my ability to use fewer plastic products for instance i cant make the decision to purchase food contained in singleuse plastics if there isnt a convenient alternative offered to me eg if i need tomatoes for a recipe and my local grocery store does not sell unpackaged tomatoes or tomatoes in compostable containers even if i take the extreme inconvenient measures to avoid singleuse plastics eg never buying products packaged in plastic refilling containers at the rare stores that allow for refills not buying products i wantneed because they are overpackaged the large large majority of other individuals have demonstrated they are not be willing to take these measures because the environmental price of plastics is currently not factored into their cost they remain artificially cheap and convenient the large majority of consumers therefore respond to these price signals ie they will continue to buy and discard unnecessary plastics because the overt cost to them is much lower than the cost of the inconvenience associated with avoiding plastics in the current economy\n i strongly believe that governments in partnership with industry have a responsibility to take the lead on these difficult issues on behalf of the public good the current issues with plastics overuse plastics waste and plastics pollution is due to market failure it is the role of government to address market failure governments have a wide range of tools to do so such as environmental leviestaxes trade policy public education and regulation i strongly encourage government you to use these tools to protect the public good\n i understand that a key barrier in addressing plasticsrelated issues is respecting canadas commitments to international trade agreements ie not creating nontariff trade barriers via plastics policies and regulations if you decide such trade barriers are required to reduce plastics waste i strongly support you in prioritizing reduced plastics usewaste these difficult negotiations with our international partners\n i expect one of the the best policy tools for reducing plastics use and waste is implementing producer takeback legislationregulation in the spirit of cradletocradle sustainable production and consumption i am disappointed the federal government has taken so little action to implement producer takeback legislation over the past few decades i strongly urge you to

especially fast food restaurants and coffee shops offered something like this it might encourage more people to routinely carry reusables if plastic shopping bags at the grocery store cost a nickel an amount that is too low to be significant deterrent then that same nickel should be deducted if the customer has their own reusable bag this could tackle the idea that charging too much for plastic

our government for this platform to expound on a very important topic i hope someone is reading it\ni suspect most readers of my comments will be unhappy with my observations i provide them only to encourage an understanding of what i think are the big issues at play in this topic\ni understand that we consume over 90 million barrels of oil a day plus a similar amount of coal and other hydrocarbons of that about 13 of the oil is converted into products like plastics the focus of most of the discussion postings on this forum is on a minuscule portion of that maybe the proverbial visible tip of the iceberg but still not significant\nbecause carbon is such a flexible atom it ends up in many molecular combinations such as plant and animal cells and of course long chain molecules we call plastics many years ago when i was personally involved in the plastics industry there were 4000 different plastics to talk about plastics in the generic sense is like discussing how we should cook food ie not really very useful because plastics are very new man made products nature has not had enough time to develop biodegradable processes that it has for cellulose and other ancient organic materials yet i am absolutely convinced that this will happen because plastics contain stored energy and are hydrocarbon based so can be reconfigured into usable hydrocarbon based lifeforms\nin support of this hypothesis i understand that according to and article in scientific journals and the globe and mail an enzyme has been discovered in japan and is being enhanced by researchers in labs at harvard and other universities that will decompose plastics back into short chain molecules which then can be further reprocessed by existing lifeforms into biologically useful molecular structures as we all know nature abhors a vacuum so it will not let this energy source go unused however a natural recycling process could take some time to evolve without human help\ni have read many of the earlier comments the thread i see running through them is the cost plastics impose on our world the comments ignore why we enjoy the functionality of plastics and their benefits to our existing lifestyle they were not imposed on us we chose to use them plastics were developed and are used for many reasons but mainly because of the fact that they do not decomposecorrode thus we need to expend time energy and economic wealth to remove them from the biosphere would we not have the same problem with paper wood metals cotton wool etc if they did not decomposecorrode because mature has solved the recycling process for these older products we dont need to do anything about processing them at the end of their economic life cycle\nso until we either reject the benefits conferred by plastcis in its many forms we must set up a recycling process until nature takes over which fortunately it usually does once sufficient product is available recycling plastics is a complex labor intensive and uneconomic process anything we individually and collectively do to voluntarily assist the process is useful but probably ineffectual until we convert plastics into another less stable product in our environment of course when this occurs it will immediately cause us to look for a plastic replacement product because of our need to perform certain tasks now being done by plastics thus restarting the whole cycle once again\nanyway that is how i see it\njim knock","emotion":"neutral"},{"comment":"i would ask the government of canada to adopt the proposal for a national

returnable packaging eg bottle deposits or packaging that can be reused by refilling it at the store i also try to avoid acquiring disposable plastic bags when shopping unfortunately i find that often

can even be recycled in ottawa and both of which are unnecessary also it is often difficult to buy organic produce without plastic packaging\n2 as a solution for governments to reduce plastic waste i suggest that plastic waste can be priced similarly to carbon the concept is simple its a cost to all of us and the environment to have all of this plastic waste why not internalize that cost into the price of any product that contains plastic i think disposable plastic bags should cost something like $1 each for example and nonrecyclable styrofoam takeout trays the same i think with that type of bold course of action which would be the costeffective approach recommended by most economists we will see a very rapid shift in behaviours at the industry and consumer level recyclable plastic

all be recyclable a big issue however are products made of a combination of different substances such as plastic as well as paper or fabrics these types of products confuse consumers in terms of whether they are recyclable or not if they should be taken apart first before recycling etc individuals should try to use less plastic and opt for items that arent unnecessarily packaged in a bunch of

items often have more packaging for instance i needed to purchase some travel mugs for a work conference the other day if i bought the mugs singly at most retailers they were approximately $15$20 each however i could purchase the bulk pack at costco containing two mugs for $13 i was very upset because the costco deal meant a lot of unnecessary packaging but at such a cost savings about $100 difference in total for my purchase i couldnt afford the better environmental choice i think people consider a variety of values in each purchase decision consciously or not and must balance a variety of conflicting interests such as wasteful packaging longevity cost impact on local economy fair trade health impacts social impacts etc in the absence of available or reliable information about all of their values people usually default to price\n2 government and industry can work to internalize the cost of plastics taking into consideration the environmental impact perhaps disincentives on

arrival and departure of a few meteorites space rockets and some radiation most of the earths surface is covered with water and soil that was once waste oil is a waste or valuable product depending on what we do with it if plastic was food we would have no plastic waste all waste is eventually recycled or we would be buried in it since it would accumulate indefinitely waste is not a distinct product but is a definition of an intermediate product of existence and life the wine we enjoy is the urine of the yeast which consumes the sugar in the grapes that is why wine can never have more than 14 alcohol since the yeast poisons itself above that concentration a good lesson for the human species\n ultraviolet radiation is very effective in breaking up the long chain carbon molecules that form plastics since plastics are primarily carbon based molecules they oxidize burn readily however probably due to their short existence there are no widespread life forms that consume plastics although some are being developed naturally and in labs so plastics cannot be recycled through normal natural processes thus we need to manage them better and not rely on nature to clean up after

in packaging or as single use grocery bags and the like\n1 take steps to minimize their use which can be driven by government regulation\n2 substitute the kinds of plastics used to ones that biodegrade\nplastic films are notoriously difficult to collect and recycle instead of relying on a system of better capture at the end of the useful life of the product requiring virtually the entire nation to take part and do so effectively better to prevent them being produced in the first place furthermore plastic films are typically not intended to survive forever the packaging on products is clearly intended to be taken off and thrown away and yet they are often made of plastics that resist degradation in the environment such as polyethylene instead of degrading into their chemical constituents these plastics are mechanically broken down into smaller and smaller chunks of plastic that then persist in the environment for ages this is a glaring failure of design if these were made of biodegradable plastics they do exist for example pla then should they enter the environment the impact is minimized\nthe government could regulate plastic usage in this case banning plastic bags unless made of biodegradable materials for example and consumers could signal their preferences by buying more sustainably packaged goods industry has a large opportunity to be proactive and develop innovative packaging designs and new materials to meet the needs in canada and in the rest of the world alternatively the government could impose a tax on plastic film packaging and use the money to fund research and retooling of industry making canada a hub for innovation in the move to a world free of plastic waste\nwith canada leading the way on this and joining a larger coalition of countries

manufacturers do not provide consumers with a nonplastic option or if a manufacturer has selected a nonplastic option it is sometimes priced higher than the nonplastic option and while i would pay more for a nonplastic item it does depend on the price as to how much more i would spend 2 i think the first step is for governments to enact laws that restrict the use of plastic in many industries this would stop plastic from getting into the world from the start and we wouldnt have to worry about what to do with it later these laws of course would need to take emergency and medicalrelated issues into account by limiting the use of plastic to items that simply cannot effectively be made of another substance\ni also think that industries should voluntarily stop using plastic where they can even if it is the cheaper option for example there is almost no good use for a disposable plastic straw that cannot be satisfied with a nonplastic straw manufacturers of plastic straws really need to evaluate if the continued manufacturing of these straws is beneficial to the world in general not just to their bottom line of course cigarette manufacturers still exist so theres definitely a good chance most manufacturers will not take into account their impact on the world as a whole which is where laws come into play\nindividuals i believe are between a rock and a hard place while individuals can opt not to purchase items made of plastic or packaged in plastic they only have so many options to choose from plus economic aspects may further limit what some individuals are able to afford individuals should be responsible to recycle as much plastic as possible but again this is dependent upon where they live and what the local government has set up in terms of waste management in most situations individuals do not have a choice as to what plastic items are and are not recycled where they live and if the item is not recycled where they live they really do not have any other option than to place it in the garbage again this is where the government can come in if recycling were a provincial or nationally managed effort there would be consistency between what can and cannot be recycled around the country individuals would be less confused and would be able to make better choices as consumers plus if recycling was managed at the provincial or national level smaller communities who do not have the resources or quantities to get good deals would be able to participate in more effective recycling programs\nfinally i think it is the governments and industrys responsibility to fund encourage and manage research that looks into the creation of products that can replace plastic while i would love to see better methods of recycling introduced as well improving recycling methods is simply a bandaid on a much larger problem of plastics being produced in the first place recycling should be a last resort for plastics the first resort should be not to

questions\n1 most sellers do not do their own packaging including grocery stores so who should be responsible for recycling the waste associated with the wastes produced when the consumer disposes of all the plastics associated with the sale\n2 since 90 of our consumer purchases are manufactured in many countries mostly outside canada so should the consumer need to pay directly or indirectly to ship the associated wastes back to the country where they are produced how about if they are packaged inside canada how about if they are packaged in another part of canada\n3 since canada has very efficient plastic waste recycling operations in most urban centers but virtually none outside cities due to distances and economies of scale do rural shoppers need to make special trips to cities to return their waste plastic\n4 anyone with a fireplace knows that small quantities of waste plastic are easily burnt without excess pollution is there any reason why burning candles or furnace oil are acceptable but not burning equivalent amounts of plastic even though both are hydrocarbons and give off the same amount of pollution\n5 from the global perspective should we send our waste plastics outside the country if it provides valuable employment to low income third world workers using canadian technology and capital\n6 if plastics provide the least cost option to many real world problems automobiles continue to up the amount of plastics in vehicle construction now approaching 25 by weight and go back to less efficient options ie through loss of durability and increased vehicle weight the consumption of hydrocarbons per average vehicle mile would increase thus adding to net greenhouse gas production and increased global warming\ni believe the real issue is what happens after the useconsumption of plastics is complete ie when their economic value switches from positive to negative from a commodity to a waste not the creation and use of plastics we could easily draft legislation that would ban plastics within canada and we would almost instantly convert canada into a third world economy should that ban be successfully enforced\nof course there is much room for reducing our waste plastic obesity doing so meaningfully should be our focus not a superficial attack on a insignificant example ie plastic straws we replaced glass natural fabrics metals etc with plastics and put a bounty on glass metals the result was these waste streams mostly disappeared now we talk about replacing plastic with glass natural fabrics metals etc because of the growth in the plastic waste streams\nplastics have many valuable characteristics thus their huge growth in new applications over the past 80 years the one characteristic that is problematic is that nature has yet to learn how to biodegrade them like it has the products plastics have replaced in the long term this will be resolved probably with human help in the short term we need to assist nature by collecting or eliminating some low utility plastic wastes and reducing them to reusable molecules that nature will then absorb and recycle\ntelling the tide what to do has never proven to be very

think we should adopt in order to help curb the use of plastic in our society and prevent the negative impacts that come with it implement a tax on all manufactures that produce plastic which is non biodegradable and cannot be recycled easily this tax could be anywhere from 5 cents a ton to 1 dollar or more of plastic that is produced having a tax on plastic manufactures will encourage them to produce less plastic waste andor invest money into research and development of plastics that would not incur this tax such as biodegradable plastics or plant based plastics known as bioplastics monies from this tax could be put into a fund controlled by the government to research strategies and ideas that can reduce plastic waste in canada and support programs across the country that are implementing plastic reduction programs diversion programs of plastic into landfills and waterways and funding to companies or individuals who are researching non petroleum based plastics such as bioplastics canada along with other g7 nations can create a global fund to help pay for better waste management practices and infrastructure a coordinated national strategy to combat plastics pollution backed up by law should be implemented across the country create a nationwide supply chain to intercept oceanbound plastic trash and turn it into everything from packaging and furniture to bicycle parts companies can seek federal investment to help run this program but would be independent implementation of a ban on black plastic food containers should also be implemented black plastic food containers and single use items are not recycled in municipalities due to recycling machines not being able to detect the color black due to conveyor belts being black implement a phased in ban of all single use petroleum based plastic items these items include plastics bags food trays non recyclable coffee cups styrofoam etc basically a ban on any single use plastic that is non recyclable or non biodegradable the public much be made aware of a ban before it is implemented in order to provide public discussion about the issue and prepare people and companies a chance to seek alternatives to petroleum based plastics for example phasing in a ban will allow time for stores to stop buying plastic bags from manufactures and seek an alternative to offer customers a phased in ban will allow customers to seek alternatives such as reusable bags which are also sold in stores a phased in ban will allow manufactures time to research design and manufacture non petroleum based plastics such as bioplastic bags which are biodegradable and can replace the single use bags we consume now while this ban is being implemented a tax should be levied on all single use plastic items such as plastic bags or coffee cups to encourage citizens and businesses to seek alternatives such as reusable bags or a travel mug to put their coffee in instead of a single use one the monies generated from these taxes can be reinvested into programs that reduce plastic waste and invested into research and development of recyclable biodegradable based plastics again the tax on single use items could be anywhere from 5 cents per item to 1 dollar or more but the tax must be enough to actually encourage people to avoid single use plastic items and therefore a tax of 1 dollar per single use item or more seems preferable the canadian government along with private industry can remove plastic waste found in the oceans and other bodies of water and reuse that plastic and make it into usable items this idea is to clean up bodies of water from the plastic that already exists within them and create strategies to prevent plastic from entering bodies of water in the first place implement a program similar to british columbias multi material bc whereby the responsibilities of recycling materials from households and businesses are taken away from municipalities who are responsible for paying for recycling and pass that responsibility onto companies and industries that create the waste in the first place doing this will force them to implement more efficient ways of recycling and reducing waste to help lower the cost they are paying for recycling in the first place municipalities and therefore citizen tax payers should not have to pay the cost of plastic waste that manufactures and businesses create canada along with the private industry should jointly invest into research design development and implementation of alternatives to petroleum based plastics these alternatives would include biodegradable plastics plant based plastics known as bioplastics enzymes that eat plastic waste and plastics that can infinitely be reused over and over again and can be recovered by manufactures for reuse from consumers creating a constant circle and thus never having the plastic enter a landfill or waterway <url>\n <url>\n <url>\n

creating too much plastic and too much carbon it is predicted that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans and current concentration levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are 410 parts per million ppm for the past 800000 years carbon dioxide levels fluctuated but never exceeded 300 ppm until the industrial revolution\nmany companies such as ikea are becoming more environmentallyfriendly by reducing their carbon emissions and plastic use while scientists are developing technologies to capture carbon from the air and use it to make plastic for the things we need and rely on such as packaging electronics medical equipment and so on\nnewlight technologies is a company that captures the carbon from the air processes it in a reactor where a microorganism biocatalyst is applied to rearrange the carbon molecules into a chain of polymers which creates a patented plastic called aircarbon it is then melted down into pellets that are shaped into items such as the chair below\nin 2016 newlight signed a 10 billion pound aircarbon production deal with ikea who gained exclusive rights in the home furnishings industry to aircarbon technology meaning we can fight air pollution and furnish our homes at the same time both dell and the body shop partnered with newlight in 2014 and 2015 respectively to make packaging using aircarbon technology\nplastics are typically made from crude oil a type of fossil fuel that produces carbon dioxide in the manufacturing process dr caothang dinh and other scientists from the university of toronto have recently developed a way to use the sun as a source of energy to convert carbon dioxide into ethylene a compound needed to make plastic\ndinh explains that the alarming rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should make us think of new ways to be more sustainable which is why renewable energy was an important part of this technology we store three tonnes of carbon dioxide in one tonne of ethylene that we produce says dinh explaining the technologys ability to remove carbon from the air\ndinh is member of the cert team that is competing in the nrg cosia carbon xprize competition where teams from around the world compete for a $20 million dollar prize for developing innovative technologies that convert carbon dioxide into valuable products cert will be competing alongside newlight technologies as two

includes single use grocery bags straws plastic water bottles cutlery and cups among others this needs to be done by the federal government as pushback will be received from other industries that help to produce these products including the petroleum industry although this may be hard single use plastics are not a necessary part of our lives and needs to be done as the first step on our journey to becoming a healthier more environmentally friendly and plastic free planet this has been seen in many countries around the world and even in some cities in canada montreal kicked off 2018 by banning singleuse plastic bags merchants will have until june 5 and after that individuals and corporations will face up to $2000 fines the city of montreal realized it was using 2 billion plastic bags a year and only 14 of those were being recycled furthermore victoria is also proposing a similar ban that will start on july 1 and will not allow businesses to provide plastic bags and instead paper bags at a cost of 15 cents these same bans and legislation should be created all over canada the federal government needs to ban singleuse plastic bags at minimum and using these two cities as models it shouldnt be to difficult 2 buying plastic free or package less products needs to be more accessible almost everything now a days including fresh products comes in plastic when you buy mixed greens it comes in a plastic tub industries companies and grocery stores are not making it easy for us consumers to purchase things without plastic packaging one idea would be to make it mandatory for all grocery stores to have a package free isle this may include refillable detergents and soaps bulk foods package free fruits and vegetables if this is included in all community grocery stores shopping package free will be much easier potentially cheaper and a lot more accessible for all reducing packaging is being seen by many smaller movements but hasnt been completely tackled by cities or countries yet however in singapore companies have been taking steps to reduce packaging under an effort called the singapore packaging agreement more than 200 companies have signed the spa and since 2007 the signatories have cumulatively reduced close to 39000 tonnes of packaging waste with cumulative savings of about $93 million in the material costs of locally consumed products there is a ways to come but it can be done\n3 i think there should be tax incentives so people are wanting to avoid buying plastics this may include increased hst on plastic items or items with plastic packaging there can also be the opposite effect as ontario lessens hst on the cost to repair old items this hopefully would result in less items going to landfill and changing the way we consume less tax or no tax could also be applied to bulk items or other things that dont involve any packaging and more specifically plastic packaging all this would promote reusing and enable people to by plastic free items for less 4 another thing to propose would be the creation of a deposit on all beverage containers and cans not just alcoholic beverage containers this would promote recycling and reduce the amount of garbage significantly an example of this is seen right next door to us in quebec they have a recycling program where they offer 5 cents for almost all cans and beverage containers if brought to the recycling center this promotes proper recycling and is not a way to ban plastic but instead lessen the overall effect","emotion":"anger"},{"comment":"plastic is made from oil canada has just

this issue i think this public consultation is a good start and that there needs to be more conversations about what should be done about this problem\na governments can introduce bans or taxes on nonessential singleuse plastics such as styrofoam takeout containers and plastic grocery bags there are governments who have already done this so we can look at which initiatives have been successful and learn from what has not worked well governments can also invest money into research on more sustainable alternatives to plastics\nb industries should make environmental stewardship a priority and reduce the unnecessary use of plastics in their products they should also work on ways to make their products longerlasting and work with governments to ensure that their products and the packing they come in are fully recyclable so that it is easier for consumers to make more environmentallyresponsible choices\nc citizens can do their part by educating themselves about our plastics problem and about their municipal recycling programs they can also avoid cheap throwaway plastic items such as singleuse plastic water bottles and disposable plates and cutlery bring reusable bags to grocery

people should never just throw any garbage on the ground or in the water and think someone else will take care of it i do not think banning a product is going to help however providing a choice so that people made educated decisions would be better example water bottles they do provide convenience but you can use a reusable one or drink from a fountaintap water with cup that can be washed if you do like straws then dont use them but they also make reusable ones when it comes to packages such as milk plastic is involved usually unless you get a carton but then they can also be recycled

use multiple use life supporting greenhouse gas reducing food saving comfort creating global warming reducing etc are all reasons for us purchasing plastics over other alternative productsservices we are not being ignorant or stupid when we buy a product that is wholly or partially made of some type of plastic we are making partially informed decisions about what is best for us our families our country our planet now and in the future\nthe technology to recycle plastics is elementary they are primarily hydrocarbon based and thus contain much unused energy this could be extracted safely there would be a cost to do this are we willing to pay that cost to do so would cut into the net benefit we now receive from using plastics maybe some would cease to to be viable ok or would have to increase in cost user pays ok since plastics are so widely distributed the biggest cost in recycling plastics will always be the cost of capture separation and collection not the cost of reconverting it back to basic safe molecules and compounds\nwe can not contemplate the disruption of removing plastics from our lives than we can really understand the impact of extracting hydrocarbons from our lives\nnature abhors a vacuum but it also abhors an excess lifeforms will eventually evolve that will recycle plastics just as they have eventually done for every atom and molecule ever created on earth unfortunately plastics are so new that only recently has nature started creating enzymes and life forms that will consume plastics and leave behind residuals that are plant and animal friendly

recycling process thats why the industry is saturated with bad grade plastic that have to be landfilled after one use b plastics = pollution everywhere all shapes of single use plastics are huge pollutants everywhere on earth really forests and being eaten by sea animals and because they breakdown in such little pieces biodegradable and oxo even worse we are now also consuming it <url>\nsolution the whole plastic jazz should be reviewed\ngoing away from high negative impact single use products styrofoam for instance and promoting less impactfull products compostable and eatable plastics for instance <url>\nhow option 1 increasing taxes on production manufacturers sell and buy establishments and end users of single usedisposable plastics everyone will have to pay high taxes for it\nmanufactures ask them what will they be producing out of raw materials if its disposablesingle use only add a higher tax to it same approach as above increasing taxes on every step of production and sell\nresults market shift more green products will have a bigger demand so the prices will drop and then people and industries will end up choosing more divertable materials vs choosing styrofoam and all because its cheaper\ncase study i am from alberta and we are just recovering from a bad crisis where many business closed many food vendors rely on every cent they can save to keep their business running they want to be more green but styrofoam is the cheapest option they have so they will keep buying it until they find something more costeffective\nhow option 2 lowering taxes or giving grants to manufactures that are producing durablereusable products give grants to business that have a circleeconomy or epr business approaches give grants to business and people that are not producing waste\nwhat do to with all that money gathered by high taxes or remaining taxes\nput on research on wider use for eatable and compostable plastics or other ideas there are so many awesome projects around the world with solutions for plastic diversion all petroleum plastics should be completely replaced by other kinds of plastics that can be easily degraded by natural processes

had to settle for sustainable design and production plastics produced from fossil fuels only continues our need for this nonrenewable resource biodegradable my definition is that the material only breaks down into smaller pieces of plastics or compostable plastics rely on heat andor oxygen for degradation many products touted as being compostable have never been pretested by the municipalities that would process these in their compost facilities and most have been rejected by the municipalities the manufacturers have only tested the products under ideal conditions in their own labs this greenwashing by manufacturers needs to stop as it misleads many consumers into believing that theyre doing the right thing im showing my age when i say that when i was a child there was very little waste this was years before the blue box the blue box program came out of necessity as manufacturers increased the amount of packaging waste that they were generating putting a strain on our landfills and the municipalities that had to deal with this waste its not just packaging waste as there is also a lot of printed paper in the waste stream stores used to place ads in the newspaper not as a separate flyer the electronic age was supposed to reduce our need to print which is a laughable concept now\nthe government and im going to say federal as somethings need to be regulated across the nation to be effective needs to restrict where plastics can be used and this means no unnecessary use of this material some of the overpackaging is a result of the need to increase product security but there are electronic ways to deal with this concern where packaging of fragile products is deemed absolutely necessary then use paperbased material ive heard of moulded pulp made from paper that had flecks of laminated plastic film throughout so this was apparently a lower grade moulded pulp\n do not laminate paper which only makes the paper harder for the recycler to process incandescent light bulbs quite fragile used to be packaged in plain boxboard but some leds not as fragile are in boxes made of laminated paper\n envelope windows used to be made of vellum and here im referring to the cellulosebased transparent material there is no need for plastic windows in envelopes or boxes\n lets restrict use of plastics to only those that have value in the blue box and thus are highly recyclable good end markets and a source of revenue for the municipalities and material processors this means in addition to glass and metal packaging we would only use pet and hdpe bottles as outlined in the link below <url>\n lets go back to reusable packaging where we can eg glass bottles for milk and pop for local goods\n the fast food industry has embraced the singleuse lifestyle and is largely responsible for the litter problem we have today you need to watch guess whos coming to dinner to see how it used to be done if they use singleuse packaging for items eaten outside of the restaurant then it must be compostable this would require compost programs be available everywhere\n paper straws need to replace single use plastic straws or better yet have consumers use reusable ones durable reusable plastic straws should be available to those who cannot use metal or silicone straws there are 2 food courts in toronto that have reusable dishes and cutlery and staff to sort the waste\n so much of the food packaged in plastic is not healthy so reducing this category would actually be a good thing transportation costs have been given as reason to use plastics which are not as heavy as other materials but reducing the amount of packaging to begin with is a better choice\ni know that a lot of the ideas posted here may be pipedreams but we need to reduce our need for

full cycle there are both those that will recycle to the highest degree possible and those that could care less there are also those that do not have the options because they do not have the tools to accomplish the recycle task there are not enough manufacturers in canada that can take an item to be recycled and turn it back into a product for reuse this causes shipping challenges and the customer base for recyclers is very low this can cause turmoil when a country like china shuts its doors to highly contaminated product specifically since canadausa product recyclers have systems where high contamination is the norm\n management of recycle systems is in the hands of municipal government in most cases while they may have a role in regulations that guide and direct households and collect fees for services they are probably the least qualified and most inefficient in the industry to handle the management functions leading to a good recycle program\n plastic would be far more easily

however our system isnt equipped to handle compostable plastics or bamboo so they wind up in the landfill where they wont have the chance to break down properly and will just contribute to our trash

included throwing every single piece of plastic in the recycling whether it be 6 styrene forkscoffee lids to those notquiterigid plastic bag containers that contain soft pasta like tortellini to even soiled sandwich meat bags from the deli they said it didnt matter that it had meat residue on it the recycling service takes it all and in any condition i think if norway can make something useful out of dirty plastic products then so can the rest of the world this whole deal about not accepting plastic shopping bags at the curb in bc metro vancouver because they might potentially have some water or food residue in them is a total lost opportunity we use reusable bags all the time and always keep some with us for spontaneous shopping but we still end up with loads of plastic bags from the inside of cereal boxes or produce bags from the grocery store etc yes we have the reusable produce bags too but theyre heavy and the store never tares the scale before weighing the produce and the self checkout stands dont have a function to we save them in bundles and take them to the recycling centre along with any styrofoam we happen to accumulate from meat packaging or unpacking boxed goods

advocated to deaf ears no matter where ive lived that there should be a total ban on all singleuse water bottles it should be illegal to sell or purchase water in bottles of less than 4 litres there is absolutely no reason that people need to use disposable singleuse water bottles when there is such an abundance of reusable bottles available\njustin trudeau seemed to be annoyingly dismissive about a ban on plastic straws but a noplastic movement has to start somewhere back in the day straws were made of paper not plastic there is no reason we could not go back to paper again if justin just cant bring himself to ban plastic straws then we should be required to specifically ask for a straw they should not be handed out automatically at drivethroughs and should be kept behind the counter in restaurants as well there should be an additional charge for plastic straws those straws can actually be reused if one takes the time to rinse them out after each use failing that why not create designer reusable nonplastic straws as was done for water bottles\nfinally provinces who do not already have a deposit refund system for recyclables should be required to institute such a programme this has a spinoff benefit of employing people at the refund sorting centres it may not dissuade people from buying plastics but it would encourage recycling to get your refund rather than tossing recyclables read plastic bottles into landfills the deposit refund system is already in place in ontario for beer wine liquor bottles so why have they not extended it to include other

recycling deposit paid by the consumer on all single use plastics and product packaging this money could to be used to facilitate andor subsidize private recycling facilities who actually recycle the materials as opposed to shipping out of country the deposit needs only be large enough to make a private recycling venture profitable not to cover the whole cost an added benefit if the fee is large enough would be to hopefully reduce general consumption of these materials which is the root cause of this issue\nthe amount of the deposit would need to vary based on material types and packaging

been evaluating the feasibility of operating smallscale wastetoenergy facilities on canadian landfill sites and transfer stations plasma gasification is a proven technology whereby a feedstock composed of hydrocarbon chains plastics food waste etc is processed into base elements through extreme heat hydrogen or synthetic natural gas syngas is fed to a gas turbine to produce electricity carbon or slack a material similar to coal with embedded impurities has a 1100 volume of the feedstock following gasification which can be either disposed at a landfill or used in the production of asphalt although a clear solution to reducing plastic pollution is reducing plastic consumption this is a fallacy society will only continue to consume singleuse petroleumderived plastics at near exponential rates until the underlying supply chain incorporates new materials examples of this include biodegradable fungal plastics which will only be incorporated when cost competitive to petroleumderived plastics at scale i therefore see plasma gasification as our greatest weapon in the fight to reducing plastics entering the canadian environment how by processing all recyclables and

plastic reduction strategy i have 12 reusable produce bags and there have been many grocery trips where i have used them all it would probably help if grocery stores sold reusable produce bags near the singleuse plastic ones to remind consumers that a choice is available\nii i try to consider if a food item can be purchased in bulk like seeds and nuts if so i bring my own reusable container for a long time i would reuse disposable sandwich bags when purchasing items in bulk but they would really begin to show their wear after four or five uses i recently discovered silicone reusable sandwich bags that can be reused thousands of times iii i have a backpack loaded with reusable shopping bags produce bags bulk bags and other containers i have learned that going grocery shopping begins by making sure i have that backpack iv the way i learned how to shop for groceries was largely determined by watching the habits of others who would go to the grocery store with no supplies and expect the store to provide all the bags and storage containers it took years for the message that this is wrong to actually sink in largely because i had to unlearn a negative habit and discipline myself into adopting a positive habit there were also social perception concerns ten years ago someone walking into a grocery store with a backpack and then reaching into it 20 times while shopping would immediately arouse shoplifting suspicions a lot of people still think this way so it actually takes a certain amount of bravery to do an activity that was once viewed with scrutiny it is wonderful that public awareness about reusable bags has made it socially acceptable to have a backpack while shopping\nv a picture of my backpack and the reusable items is provided on the noticeboard notice that a laundry drying rack is used for the produce bags and a plastic bag drying rack is used for the sandwich bags cleaning the reusable items is an important part of the process\nvi public awareness and education is really important to help shoppers change their habits i recently saw reusable bags that had a message on the bag saying this is the bag i always forget which was a clever reminder\nvii churches and their congregations are concerned about the environment so it is likely that education campaigns for changing shopping habits may be wellreceived and actually adopted by those spiritually motivated to care for the planet a few years ago there was a presentation at my church discussing the moral imperative to buy fair trade products and it really moved me to adopt that

leading to plastic waste and marine litter our government should be considering supporting a project that gets to the root cause our government should also be investing in campaigns such as 1 an educational campaign about the benefits of plastics including educating and encouraging people to reuse and recycle more 2 to increase waste and proper disposal of plastics our government should be investing in towns that cant afford or sustain proper recycling programs 3 a lot of canadians are misinformed about the benefits of plastics our canadian government should do their homework on the benefits and kickstart a promotional campaign about how plastics can make our lives better this educational campaign could certainly be combined with proper disposal and reuse 4 another investment for our canadian government to consider is encouraging more research innovation by offering incentives 5 support an initiative to validate or revalidate the root cause of marine debris and invest in a

asking fundamental questions before the purchase is even considered or made we are at the point that recycling is clearly no longer sufficient the cycle in this specific order should be need reuse dispose recycle donate before considering waste therefore before we even want to purchase a product we should ask our self do i actually need this item what will i benefit or my family of this purchase then before sending it to recycling is there another usage for this item before i dispose of it can i donate this item before a more evasive approach 2 simply policies or laws to impose significant changes plastic bag banished from retail and grocery stores if they are not compostable same with disposable products such as styrofoam coffee cups and plastic plates 3 stimulate

characteristics they do not decompose easily if we modify them so they do readily decompose they cease to be useful for many current applications thus their design is the underlying cause for their waste management problems if we eliminate this characteristic we significantly reduce their utility\nanother consideration is that plastics are new they have existed for less than a century i would propose that nature will have found naturally produced enzymes and bacteria that will break down plastics just as has occurred through normal evolution for virtually every energy rich compound ever produced on the planet i fact i recently read that the japanese have isolated a naturally occurring enzyme that does this and is actively being propagated at several major na universities maybe we are

the organization could be utilized to provide tools training coaching or mentoring in the organizations sphere of influence and perhaps beyond communities really need to remove those items from the waste stream that do create the challenges and or provide the tools to collect them or some how remover them from the system communities can provide incentives in the form of space to help others organize or have space to properly establish proof of concept projects or full scale projects","emotion":"excited"},{"comment":"here are some ways to help motivate and mobilize individuals organizations communities and beyond to help reduce and clean up plastic litter <url>\n <url> by aasiya hussain\nper the above cherishing our shared waters by aasiya hussain\n1 reconnect with nature and engage in directaction conservation\nwhen we reconnect with nature were more inclined to cherish it so explore the outdoors and nurture nature in your children to become water stewards take a hike along water or try a lowimpact water sport while treading lightly on your chosen location\nas you explore where natural habitats and people intersect you may also find litter which pollute our waterways entangle wildlife and is mistaken by wildlife for food you can help prevent this by joining a great canadian shoreline cleanup shoreline cleanups are a tangible means to mitigate pollution reduce threats to wildlife and ecological health and reconnect people with nature to help keep our shared waters healthy and sustainable\nits easy to join a cleanup and you can host your own too to learn how visit <url> it makes a positive tangible impact too the data speaks for itself <url> 2 rethink refuse reuse reduce repair recycle>upcycle\nrethink our connection with water and waste with ~91 of global plastic not being recycled and with recycling usurping massive resources and energy to recycle the solutions must be on refusing wasteful packaging etc to begin with to reduce it opting for affordable accessible reusable options or designing and advocating for them if lacking repairing what can be repaired to avoid sending it to landfills and or waste polluting our waterways land and beyond and upcycling what may be considered waste into something new for closedloop solutions in essence striving towards zerowaste\n3 vote with your wallet\nby consciously choosing options that go towards zerowaste as much as within ones capacity one can help push industry research and development design and governance towards zerowaste solutions\n4 empowering positive change\nharness your talents and personal connection with water to create positive tangible change in your life at work and within civil society governance business and industry to make water sustainability flourish aasiya hussain\nthis being said it must be recognized that this can come with privilege and barriers not everyone may have the capacity to go fully zerowaste or even fully zero plastic waste there may be financial disability health logistical access or even governance barriers\nsome thoughts on this through another piece by the same author\n1 acceptance release and resiliency much is not in ones control regarding health and disability barriers whats key is trying ones best from what is within ones capacity with sincere intentions and not being hard on yourself with things not in your control for many with health and disability concerns their lives may depend on medical devices and treatments which due to health and safety require singleuse andor plastic disposables as much as we hate plastic disposables eg infusions catheters feeding tubes frequent bloodworkinjectionsetc pill bottles etc 2 privilege advocacy universal design and ableism a persons with the privilege of not facing health and disability barriers do not have the right to be upset with those who do many may not even realize their approach may have tinges of ableism eg campaign slogans like stop sucking can give the impression of telling someone unable to drink at all without a straw to stop living not the intention of course but still ableist further what many may not realize is that not everyone has the privilege of being able to wash reuse or even do food prep themselves as barrierfree as those not facing these barriers they may not have assistance to either and some may be facing water scarcity barriers to washandreuse yet we can still do so much see below\nb the onus is not on persons with disabilities and health barriers to constantly advocate for and defend themselves rather the onus is on industry civil society and governance to develop affordable zerowaste solutions with accessibility and universal design inherent in product design and decisionmaking per duty to accommodate when developing solutions decisionmakers and designers need to realize that an acceptable solution is not relegating persons with disabilities and health concerns to harmful disposable plastics for they need and deserve plasticfree alternatives as well with plastics including foam and some plastic medical devicesivsetc confirmed being made of toxins carcinogens and hormone disruptors we shouldnt be resigned to it as status quo for those with health and disability concerns instead there must be a shift to developing safer affordable plasticfree zerowaste alternatives with accessibility inherent in their design and making this available to persons with disabilities health concerns and all\nalso important to realize when engaging in zerowaste discourse and product design is that health concerns and disabilities are diverse and multifaceted what may work for one may not for another hence the need for inclusive consultation discourse design and decisionmaking to develop inclusive accessible barrierfree innovative solutions c sometimes necessity and firsthand experience brings innovative solutions since we face barriers every day we reflect on innovative solutions to break through them voice feedback etc its how inventions and alternatives arise its also how ecohesian inc has been releasing accessibility reviews regarding reusable straws and beyond given firsthand experience with health and disability concerns while also being committed to go zerowaste <url> its also how an ehlersdanlos syndrome patient developed a more userfriendly reusable menses cup with more universal design to address accessibility barriers experienced by herself and others its also how several are now developing 3d prostheses made of plastic waste amazing many more examples these are just a few if theres a solution to this waste crisis you may be thinking of an idea or dream youd like to pursue or have implemented or advocate for go for it release the shackles of what ifs and what these limitations mean for reaching ones potential seek guidance and collaboration harness your inner gifts and expertise and with humility let this radiate to inspire the world towards positive change be it in advocating for inclusive accessible solutions or in developing an innovative solution based on your authentic lived experience\n3 rethinking repurposing waste its amazing how much we can still do despite barriers all it takes is a mindshift eg\na valuing ones contributions and that of others what am i already doing that i may not have realized is a powerful means of inspiring zerowaste eg many with health and disability barriers inherently strive for zerowaste because its already hard enough if not impossible for some to bring out waste to the curb on waste collection day how can we leverage this to inspire positive public engagement campaigns inspiring more to reduce waste or take the example that some require the use of handheld or handsfree bidets in lieu of toilet paper for accessibility reasons how can this be a means to inspire others towards these zerowaste options they may not have thought of before\nb repurposing unavoidable waste can unavoidable waste be upcycled into something new eg several outdoor schools use sanitized pill bottles to upcycle naturesoundshakers for their young students and may appreciate donations of these sanitized items upcycling waste for art therapy donating it for art installations and projects etc\n donating unavoidable sanitized medical plastic and waste to those upcycling them into 3d printed prostheses\n etc\nthe possibilities are endless focus on what you can do and release the guilt of what you dont have control over you matter and were all in this together aasiya hussainread

who believe in showing true care and respect to our planet those voices are not swayed by pressure from large corporations pushing for fossil fuels or plastic production but rather those voices come from a place of deep respect for the 7 generations who will follow us and who will live with the consequences of our action or inaction indigenous elders have the knowledge on how to respect our planet and if that involves uncomfortable government policy then i think we need to be courageous and finally do what is right too often governments try to balance what is good for the economy and what is good for the environment and always at a cost to the environment the problem of plastic pollution is so widespread that there are little or no bodies of water that are untouched by this and it

garbage for recycle the ships should be checked prior to leaving and at the destination to ensure that the products gets to destination and to processing\n <url>\n <url> is this true 5 countries at 60\n2 recycle and reuse of plastics into products such as bricks should be given major incentives tax breaks grants for example some countries i believe were or are incorporation some of the appropriate items nonleachable rfom recycle etc into roadbeds of new streets and highways 3 right now online productdelivery companies like amazon ebay are putting millions of boxes and packing materials into the system what are the alternatives\n4 we need to find reuses for styrofoam perhaps with unusable glass into roadbeds shred into packing material\n5 any boatshipfreighter that dumps needs to have escalating fines to the ownercompany this includes private boats this dumping is a much worse issue than cambridge analytica\n6 public garbage cans all need lids most do already\n7 we need g7 to support a y2k approach to this remember that those that were doing well with y2k helped those that were not we need to help countries eg top 520 offenders to just stop the littering and dumping this is afffecting our food sources and our health for generations to come\n8 we need to create a business that can actually harvest the ocean dumps into something bill gates and now mark

bags cutlery plastic wrap etc there are alternatives to these such as metal straws cloth bags wood cutlery beeswax paper that can be used instead and would save a lot of trash from going to the ocean and landfill am i perfect in using alternative no and it is something i work on everyday but we need to come together as a country and start making these items unavailable or limited the grocery store

items life cycle than to produce the waste and worry about finding ways to reuse and recycle it therefore strategies should first and foremost focus on plastic reduction this could include requirements from producers and manufacturers to make lowpackaging and package free goods switching back to paper and glass packaging and packaging made from one material making a plasticfree lifestyle more attainable for all canadians by educating and informing the public about ways to reduce plastic use in their daily lives ie bring your own reusable water bottle nationallevel strategies on lowhainging fruit that would result in big singleuse plastic reduction wins such as banning plastic bags at grocery and retail stores undertaking a campaign to eliminate plastic straw use at restaurants severely limiting bottled water consumption in areas where potable water is available and campaigns to encourage reusable drink containers at coffee shops since a large amount of plastic waste already exists reuse and recycle also have to be taken into account public education campaigns on how to reuse items to extend the lifetime of singleuse plastic products could be developed though many municipalities throughout canada already have recycling systems in place recycling should be mandatory for every jurisdiction within the country to ensure waste diversion is maximized additionally funds should be allocated to research and development in the areas of efficient ways to clean up plastic in the ocean uses for plastic waste that cant be recycled or is to expensive to

to see us take a leadership roll in reducing the global impact many of the rivers on the list come from developing nations with few resources to address the problem i believe that canada either

being generated from uneducated opinion or a subset of the facts the only proper solutions will be generated from a holistic view of the use of plastics the reality is that plastics offer so much value in the right applications making our lives easier safer and healthier in ways we arent always fully aware of whether providing muchimproved food protection minimizing food waste generating lower environmental impact in their production relative to plastic substitutes or contributing to other environmental benefits in their usage such as through lightweighting of materials reducing transportation costsemissions through to so many other benefits in our lives plastics are here for a reason any ban or reactive legislation without understanding the full picture risks creating unintended consequences there are valid study results showing that replacing plastics with substitute materials would result in roughly a 4 times increase in environmental impact imagine a reflexive decision targeted at plastic elimination for the purpose of waste reduction inadvertently increasing ghg emissions and negatively impacting another of our environmental focus areas personally i want ot have my cake and eat it too i do want to minimize waste and i want to reduce our broader environmental footprint the waste piece can largely be addressed through improvements in human behavior targeted at what we do with our plastic materials after using them and improved access to recycle value streams most of which already exist yet arent accessible everywhere my vision is a world with increased plastic usage must be a recyclable material in order to reduce the overall environmental footprint and significantly improved access to recycle facilities to manage the waste stream or wastetoenergy facilities in concert with improvements in our behaviours globally please look at the whole picture im speaking as a citizen a chemical engineer and an industry person the answers may seem complex but only need the right balanced guidance to find true solutions not bandaids that merely shift the problems even singleuse plastics provide real value and likely are all recyclable if we
