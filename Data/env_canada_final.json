            "comment": "Yes we need to reduce plastics,  but why are there barriers to recycling?  \nThere is no need for plastic straws, cups when paper ones work. Plastic bags is another issue,  but in many cases are necessary. However,  paper bags do work. Foam packaging should be banned as cardboard protection works just fine. The big issue for me though is the inefficient recycling programs. Too many musts and do nots. Secondly the entire process for collection is total nonsense. Finally,  why do we not have more plants to process glass and plastics metals here in Canada?  Why is stuff sent to China(or other nations).",

            "comment": "These are little ideas: I am at a loss when I go to the supermarket and the only way to buy mixed greens these days is in a clamshell plastic container. Supermarkets need to be regulated so they must offer such items in bulk so a consumer can use a reusable vegetable bag to put the the greens in. On that note, why aren\u2019t they selling reusable vegetable bags in the produce section. I had to order mine online. Also, milk, juice,  should be available in recycled glass containers like beer growlers. Bulk items should be able to be put into reusable standard jars. And ban the ridiculous over packaging of items. All packaging (that is absolutely necessary - companies should have to have their packaging approved by a regulator) should be recyclable. I would welcome tougher government regulations, even if it made my life less \u2018convenient\u2019.",

The push-back will be hard but short because people and industry in our heart of hearts, we know what is the right thing to do.\n\n1.  Single use grocery store bags, straws - all single use plastic must be banned.  This a job for the federal government because of the vigorous and legal push-back from the plastic bag industry backed by the petroleum industry.  Municipalities even as big as Toronto have back down from a single-use plastic bag ban because of threatened law suits.  We need a FEDERAL policy - law and decision so that the industry cannot bully by singling out one small group at a time!\n\n2. Municipalities must be convinced, encouraged, supported to collect recyclables without plastic bags. It is possible - see waste collection Montpellier France.  Many (some) individuals will do the right thing reduce, reuse etc...but most won't until there is leadership from government.  This is a role for Federal government first and foremost - exacting a minimum action and rewarding cities who get onboard.\n\nYours truly \nSusan Murwin",

The government needs to put the onus of tackling the problem on the manufacturers of plastics and companies that use excessive packaging to sell products.\nNot with fines or carbon taxes, large corporations will just pay the fines and continue bad practices. Recycling is good but the goal should be to reduce the amount of plastic being created. Instead of government liquor stores maybe they could have government recycle stores where products can be purchased in bulk for reduced amounts and people can use refillable containers etc.",

In terms of packaging, I consider the amount of packaging that an item has (i.e. the less plastic the better), and what type of plastic that packaging is made of (i.e. is it recycled in my municipality). If it is a longer term item, I consider the quality of the plastic, aiming to buy a higher quality item so that it will last longer.\n\n2. Governments: ban the use of plastic straws, plastic cotton swabs, PLASTIC BAGS, plastic cutlery, and other consumer single use items. Governments have a huge influence over industries that create these items and need to lead the way on influencing people's habits and ideas if we are going to tackle this problem. Governments can also set standards for industry about how much packaging they use, and the types of plastic used (i.e. recyclable or biodegradable). This could be particularly effective for single use coffee cups. It may be unrealistic to ban them entirely, but making them mandatory to be biodegradable can reduce their lifetime in landfills.\nIndividuals: Stop using single use items whenever possible. Period. This includes straws, cutlery, coffee cups, plastic swabs, stir sticks. There are reusable options for all of these items. I entirely understand that sometimes these items must be used. People lead busy lives and can forget to bring along those items. But, if we work to integrate using with these reusable items into our lives, we will all be much better off.\nIndustries: Stop the use of excessive plastic packaging. There are quality standards for packaging that need to be met for every industry, but searching for reusable packaging options wherever possible can save money for companies and save the Earth. There are also many biodegradable packaging options coming into the market. They may be more expensive, but I can guarantee consumers will start to look for these options given all of the distressing news coming out about plastic waste.",

Years ago these things were sold in glass bottles and glass can be easily recycled. ALL packaging should be recyclable -  companies should have to have their packaging approved by a regulator.

It\u2019s disappointing that Canada is seen as a world leader, but we\u2019re already behind in this one smart, simple solution. Given that plastic is made using both crude oil and natural gas, the cynic in me wonders what lobbyists are at work, putting pressure on the Government to avoid this type of ban in Canada. What other rationale or reason could our Government have for not doing the right thing, right now?",

If there is any difference between a retailer's \"Deposit fees collected\" and \"Deposit fees paid out\" accounts, that will be the carbon tax that some buyers are still willing to pay instead of recycling, and the government can collect this amount and spend it on clean ups.\n\nYou can work with businesses to modify their packaging, go to bulk supplies, instead of individually wrapping every 2 bolts and nuts in plastic and switching to paper bags and cardboard boxes.  Retailers can have one visible item on display.   There is no need for every item to be visible through a blister pack.",

            "comment": "1. Naturally, convenience is probably the main factor for me when I go shopping: essentially the availability, usability, and visibility of alternative options. To use the common example of plastic bags: I'll often bring reusable bags to one nearby grocery store (Real Canadian Superstore), but if I don't have enough, I'll likely go straight to plastic bags since they don't have a cheap alternative. Safeway I always hit on the way from somewhere else, so I never have reusable bags with me. They do have paper bags as a free alternative, but they're thin, handle-less, and genuinely impossible to carry: so plastic bags it is. But a final, more local grocery store (Fresh St. Market) carries thick, handle-able and free paper bags, and while they still default to plastics, the paper bags are kept in plain sight. So at Fresh St., I'll grab paper bags without a second thought.\n\n2. I strongly agree with others' sentiments about banning plastic bags, as well as plastic straws. Once again, other countries have done it successfully, we only need to look to them to gain a solid foundation. Regular product packaging might be trickier to implement, given the variety of companies and products, but should nonetheless be feasible. To use Fresh St. Market in Vancouver as a good example again, they wrap their seafood in paper instead of plastic and that works out just fine. Some of their bakery products and the like also use paper packaging, but unfortunately the vast majority of products are still plastic-encased.\nSomeone else in this discussion mentioned Nada in Vancouver, which looks incredibly promising. I would google that if you haven't already heard of it. If that becomes mainstream, we'll have a good place to point and say, \"See, there ARE alternatives that work.\" The distant hope is that government could then bring down their heavy hammer and say, \"Follow their example.\" But I wouldn't wait too long for that, and in the meantime I would take other participants' advice to ban the worst culprits and mandate biodegradable packaging for the next few, while also improving recycling guidelines for clarity and convenience.",

            "comment": "1.) I consider the returnable types of plastics, such as containers! Plastic bags, soft plastic wraps, plastic sheets or plastics laminated to card (hardboard are not easily recycled. These materials cannot easily be separated from the single stream systems and are notorious for wrapping around separation equipment such as star screens.  \n2.) Government can regulate plastics bags, plastic wrap and laminated type plastics out of the system. Government can regulate packaging companies to consider recycle regulations that ensure manufacturers are able to pay the price of returning these materials back to a Canadian facility for reuse. Government can ensure every item is separated for proper pick up and delivered to the proper recycle locations.\n2.b.) Individuals can ensure they separate at home and those that do not follow the rules are penalized as enforcement.\n2.c.) Industry needs to get standardized in how they track recycling and provide accurate information to the stake holders. Government and third party industry participants do not provide accurate numbers and frequently say they are recycling when they are not. \nGovernment regulations should provide incentive for industry to use more environmentally friendly products to be used to package their products. A combination of government, industry and individuals should provide value added recycle solutions in communities across Canada. Providing facilities to remanufacture recycle products into items the community may need again, providing a full cycle for materials. This solution also provides incentive for manufacturers to open in Canada ensuring recycle material can stay in Canadian markets and no need to transport them to the US or off the continent.",

Federal laws which are the same across all of Canada are needed. Fractured governance and jurisdiction creates too many loopholes and excuses for not doing anything. Multiple layering of plastic packaging taken home in yet more single use plastic is abhorrent. Food safety is an over exaggerated excuse or multiple wrapping. Too often supermarket checkout staff are ill informed and do not take a roll in promoting better choices.",

            "comment": "Industries can reduce plastic by coming up with a new material that is either recyclable or biodegradable. E.g. plastic coffee cup lids in stores such as donut franchises (Tim Horton\u2019s) or coffee shops (Starbucks) and disposable (to go) cups. It is unclear whether those coffee cup lids are recyclable or simply indicating that they were made from recycled materiel. The cups themselves DO NOT indicate that they can be recycled. Ultimately, the reliance on one-time use plastics, given their huge demand and consumption by customers, must change. Business can be provided tax incentives or awarded a certain title by provincial and municipal governments for being environment conscious. Businesses can introduce reusable coffee mugs\/containers to be purchased and eventually phase out disposable lids and cups. Those who require a disposable cup can be charged an additional fee e.g. $2.50 per purchase or pay a reduced fee for coffee\/tea when using reuse able containers. It is hoped that changes in fees will entice businesses to be environmentally friendly as they make a marginal profit, and customers\u2019 purchasing behaviours will change to prevent paying extra fees for being environmentally unfriendly. Working with local governments, domestic and foreign businesses that want to establish themselves in Canada must meet certain standards and size criteria that makes financial and practical sense for both providers and consumers.",

            "comment": "1 - There has been a lot of coverage in the media recently, about how Canadians are recycling \"wrong\", that we're attempting to recycle plastics that aren't recyclable, and it's causing all of the plastics to be sent to the landfill. It's 2018, why is there such a thing as a non-recyclable plastic? Our government should immediately move to require that all packaging for all items must be 100% recyclable. Canadians aren't recycling wrong, industry just simply isn't keeping up with our desire to recycle all the packaging our purchases are packaged in.\n\n2 - Our recyclables are being sent to China and other countries over seas. Why? How can that be justified as environmentally sound? We should be creating recycling centers in our own country. This will not only make us responsible for recycling our own waste, it will create jobs and help fuel the economy.\n\n3 - There has been coverage in the media recently that recyclables are being sent to the landfill, because it's not profitable enough to actually recycle. I thought recycling was about helping the environment and creating less waste, when did it switch to become about making millions or billions in profit? \n\n4 - it's 2018, time to get rid of plastic bags completely. 100% recyclable paper bags, made from recycled materials, should be the only option when you forget to bring your own reusable bags. There are also small mesh bags available for produce, so there's no need for those small impossible to open plastic bags in the grocery store.\n\n5 - single use plastic straws aren't necessary for the majority of the population (for some they're medically necessary, paper straws and reusable straws are an option there). Our government can make the commitment today to get rid of them... without spending millions to create a committee to study the issue, create a cute catch name and values & mission statement, meet several times a year to study it, create a preliminary report, then a secondary report, then hold consultations with industry, then more studies, another report, a recommendations report, several political debates, years of continued waste...good grief they're plastic straws, they're a problem, get rid of them. This one is just so simple.",

We did not ask ordinary Canadians for their ideas. The government banned it. Plastics are a more complex problem, because there are so many types and they are so pervasive in consumer products. \n\nSo consult enough to figure out the right goal: no single-use plastic after year X, or something like that. Then convene industry, academia, NGOs, governments and hammer out how to get the job done. But I have to say, asking my fellow citizens and me for our general ideas is Twinkie policy-making: all soft and sweet, but no substance.",

They are unnecessary, other jurisdictions have already banned them and they are significant polluters in our environment. Great first step. I would like to see more movement with plastic grocery bags, Canada is a wealthy nation so the nominal fee we are paying for plastics bags at the cash has not been enough of an disincentive for people to bring in reusable bags. While living in France, the plastic bags were completely eliminated from grocery stores with only 1 euro or larger more expensive bags available at the cash. People weren't fazed and brought in their shopping bags or baskets. Canada should bring in similar measures. I would also like to see less packaging in Canadian stores when it comes to produce and meats. Those little styrofoam plates and bunch bagging should be eliminated. They are just garbage stuffers. We have been conditioned to have everything we buy neat, tidy and perfect. It is unsustainable. It is also a sales technique that increases food waste. Instead of buying an onion, shoppers are forced to buy a bag. It is expensive for small families, poor families and people on pensions. I regularly leave excess packaging at the store as a message, but this isn't enough. The packaging still ends up in landfills, recycling facilities and our environment. It's time for the government to stop listening to the whiners and political doomsayers and just legislate the changes.",

            "comment": "1) Does it come in contact with food? I have recently started trying to avoid plastics altogether in that area, opting for glass or steel when the option is available. Unfortunately, plastic hides in so many places that even when trying to avoid it you still end up purchasing it. I wish packaging had some sort of a \"contains plastic\" logo on it. It's frustrating opening up a cardboard package, just to be greeted by a plastic bag. I also consider what it's made out of: I also look at the resin indicator when it's available. I wish the indicator was mandatory on products sold in Canada, because a lot of items don't have it (children's toys especially), so you have no idea what it is you're buying and bringing into your home.\n\n2) I would like to see the government review its current policies to ensure that we aren't accidentally forcing companies to use plastic to meet health and safety code if it's not actually necessary for that product. I know the French are doing a lot to reduce their single use plastics, we should be looking to them for ideas. I would like to see a tax on plastic packaging, and I would like to see that tax go directly to research on recycling, closed loop design, sustainable product development, and clean up initiatives(not general revenue!). I would like industries to be forced to show the life cycle of their product and how it can be recycled\/reused\/repurposed at the end of it's life prior to being allowed to bring it to market. It should be part of the initial review process. Individuals can reduce their plastic waste by actually considering what they're using instead of running on autopilot. Sustainable replacements for single use plastics are actually widely available now, but most people don't know a) that they're an option, or b) where to find them. I watched a video recently about a pay per pound compost system in South Korea. Municipalities could institute something similar with regards to waste in general, where the largest producers pay a premium and the lowest producers get a discount. Also, with regards to bringing waste home, we could do a lot to educate consumers on how to shop with their own containers and bags. Have grocery stores teach cashiers\/deli clerks\/bakers how to tare a container when filling it\/ringing it through. I remember when living in Denmark ~15 years ago that there were machines where you could return your empty bottles right at the grocery store. They printed out a slip with your deposit return on it, and you could get the cash back at the cashier or use it towards your grocery purchase. It was cleaner and much more sanitary that the currently bottle depot set up, because you're returned your bottles weekly instead of collecting them in a bag for a couple months.",

            "comment": "1) My number one gripe: Unnecessary overpackaging.\n\nAs just one example, when was the last time you bought vitamins\/meds where the bottle wasn't even half full or in an oversized blister pack. This kind of thing is strictly for marketing purposes -grabbing more shelf space and product visibilty. Excuses about labelling requirements and settling during modern manufacturing processes are weak at best -there are such things as shakers and peel back labels, or how about simply putting more product in the same container -products often cost much less than the packaging.\n\nAnother example is shipped purchases: a product, wrapped in a plastic bag, in protective packing material, inside the retail box, inside more protective packing material, inside a much larger shipping box -what a waste. Places like Amazon are at least making a start with their \"Frustration-free Packaging\" to save on shipping volume surcharges, even though most products still start out in retail packaging that gets discarded by Amazon, hopefully responsibly recycled, but still not overly green. As online shopping increases, even online grocery shopping, more items can now be bulk packed right from the start by the manufacturer with minimal impact on marketing. More items should also be manufactured for direct shipping in a padded envelope or plainish brown retail box with just a barcode label (including brand, product name, model number in moderate sized font) and a QR-code label (for getting product information) -other printed information can be inside. Many items only need pictures and attention getting large labelling for the retail shelf.\n\nPerhaps also encourage shippers to charge more by volume and less be weight -as long as their bottom line doesn't change, what does it matter. Customs and the post office also gripe about sorting small padded envelopes -maybe it's time for new equipment.\n\n2) My next biggest gripe: Unnecessary non-biodegradable or non-recyclable package liner materials.\n\nAs one example, how often do you see plastic windows glued to the box and clear molded plastic or styrofoam product holders inside the box where a crude molded pulp paper liner (egg carton) with a picture on the box could be used? The difference in materials, manufacturing and shipping costs would be minimal, if any. Again, it's more about marketing than manufacturing.\n\nHow often do you see molded plastic product liners without a plastics code number and wonder what to do with it? Unidentified plastics either aren't accepted for recycling or have to go into the low quality stream.\n\n3) Possible solutions: We already have industry supported green certifications, such as Ocean Wise, Certified Organics, Forest Stewardship Council, Fairtrade, even Ecologo. Why not EcoPack, or some such? No need for government regulation. Consumers need to shop their conscience. Conscientious retailers need to pressure the manufacturing industry to certify products. Retailers could even enhance their loyalty programs by increasing reward points on eco certified products or having \"EcoPack\" sale days.",

            "comment": "Yes the consumer can refuse single-use cups, straws, bags, and containers, but that ultimately amounts to a fraction of what an industry will use and discard in a single day. Make manufacturers label their packaging and only use materials that can be sustainably recycled. Tax plastic straws like you would cigarettes, add purchase and recycling tax to items that come in plastic packaging, and Ontario really needs to have a recycling fee program like the one in Alberta for bottles and cans. Legislate that coffee shops MUST charge customers for single-use items, and those charges MUST be a separate item on a bill, and that money goes to fund the item's disposal (aka the coffee chain is still paying manufacturing for those items). I know there's already a $0.10 discount for bringing in your own mugs at most coffee places, but people will definitely notice it more if they realize their habit is making coffee more expensive. Bagged milk is a joke, but I'm really proud that Bulk Barn has introduced the bring-you-own container initiative. \n\nPlastic packaging is plain unnecessary. The Canadian government should work with organizations like Terracycle to improve our own waste management system and expand on the breadth of things we can recycle. And yes, we definitely want more recycling options because I have no clue what to do with those bags of air Amazon mails me. I've seen a lot of people scoff at others who are attempting to make greener choices, when reality really should be the opposite. Making \"garbage\" worth money is the easiest way to do it. \n\nI read somewhere that some overseas companies, in order to avoid paying import taxes on lumber, would ship random goods in shipping crates made of slabs of mahogany. Those crates were then simply the \"packaging\" and were disassembled after they land and sold again as lumber. I think it's time to stop thinking of packaging as a collateral \"given\" and start focusing on it as a good all on its own.",

When offered choices most consumers are becoming savvy to what we are doing to the earth. But in grocery stores and  thfast food industry in particuliar the companies have to do better.

I've brought my mug before and places such as McDonalds don't even make it any cheaper for you... they pay for each individual cup and could save on operating costs if they didn't have to buy so many disposables all the time yet they still don't incentivize it! Incentivizing is a win-win for the consumer and the industry. Where is the policy that allows you to bring your own cup or own containers for food and give a mandatory price reduction at the MINIMUM equivalent to the cost of the disposables that would otherwise be used? Disposables as a whole are just a completely unnecessary part of our society. Wasting time and effort making them and wasting resources and energy throwing them away or recycling them. An outright ban on them should be put in place... if they were banned people would start bringing their own... the only reason they don't right now is because there is literally no reason not to unless you are environmentally conscious, which not everybody is. I find it absolutely disgraceful how a business like Mc Donald's or other fast food restaurants can carry some recyclable products (such as the bags or coffee cups), yet inside they have 0 recycling bins for this products only straight to the landfill. Why do they even bother making recyclable disposables and not even have bins for them there? Try going to a McDonald's in Saskatoon, every one I've been to has no bin. Where is the legislation saying this is mandatory? We keep talking about making change, reducing waste and all but policy is lacking hugely. Time to follow other countries leads - ban plastic bags, ban disposables, ban non-recyclable packaging - these are products that incentivize laziness and perpetuate this disposable culture. A disposable culture equals a disposable society at the rate we're going. If change wants to happen it needs to happen now.",

As much as possible, we try to avoid plastic packaging, but this is not always possible.    There is just so much plastic everywhere!\n\nThe Canadian Government needs to think about the global impact of the fossil fuel industry and the viability of future generations on this planet. This means that the government has to take firm actions to stop the acidification of our oceans and protect all life on Earth.  \n\nWe need to take a stand and be a global leader as time is running out.  Consider countries in Africa such as Rwanda and Kenya that have banned the use of plastic bags (there is a hefty fine for plastic bag use).  We applaud Great Britain in its efforts to mobilize the Commonwealth Countries to join GB in banning the use of plastic.  \n\nIndustries need to find alternative ways to package their goods and consider their impact on the environment.\n\nIndividuals need to reduce consumption because recycling is not a viable solution.   Factory farming is one of the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas, deforestation, water consumption, world hunger (17,000 people, mostly children die daily due to hunger), and ocean acidification due to run-offs from factory farms.  If we were to consume a plant-based diet, our planet would be healthier and so would we and we would save on healthcare cost.\n\nPlease talk less, and do more!",

At my church we collected old appliances and were paid for them sold in bulk, this should be readily available...not just the sight of a black trash bin. Goodwill shut its doors because it could not sustain in the economy...this is how used plastic items were received and left out of the landfill. How can the government help these agencies who are helping the environment and the vulnerable?\n\nRegulate the materials used at fast food restaurants and pre-made grocery store containers that are not recyclable. \n\nEncourage selling products in a clear biodegradable wrapper with logo imprints for toys, offer reduced taxes if compliance with packaging pilot.",

I read of a recent Danish Envioronmental Protection Department study which concluded that single use plastic grocery bags were less harmful to the environment overall than all alternatives.  In particular, the carbon footprint is much lower than for reusable bags.  The answer is not to ban them but to require the stores to recycle them and audit for compliance.",

The plastic is discarded or recycled before it hits the shelf. The average consumer doesn't see this.  I feel that the majority of plastic waste is created by manufacturing companies. Is there a way to combat this?? Every headphone, every charging cable, every little gadget came, needlessly from the manufacturer wrapped in it's own plastic bag. This is so wasteful! I messaged the reps for these companies and it seems they had little say. Are there laws we can create in order to change the manufacturing practices of companies??",

There are several key players from the plastics industry in Canada who have been pushing hard for years to use junk plastics as fuel, collected through recycling and EPR stewardship programs, not getting off of junk plastics?\n\nIf the goal is to try and keep junk plastics out of the environment and out of garbage dumps, this excersise would have a greater chance of being successful if we had both \"disposal\" options in the guidelines?\n\nIt must be noted a large card the pro garbage burner folks often play is \"the economics\" of burning\/plasmafication\/gasification. We're concerned about the \"keeping plastics in the economy\" part. What's the true full cost accounting of single use disposable plastics in the economy?\n\nWe don't need more gimmicks, we need to hunker down and end the era of single use disposable plastics.",

            "comment": "Generally if possible, I try to choose products that have limited or no plastic packaging.  However, sometimes this can be very difficult as many items do not seem to have a plastic-free option, even if plastic is completely unnecessary.  For example, I've seen more and more often lately in grocery stores that produce is fully encased in plastic.  I've seen peppers, carrots, snap peas, mushrooms and more wrapped in plastic and\/or styrofoam, with no other option for unwrapped items.  This seems ludicrous to me- these types of foods have zero need to be wrapped in plastic!  Seeing this in stores is very disheartening- it means that I either have to buy the plastic-wrapped food against my morals, or not buy it\/ look somewhere else.  Since people will usually follow the easiest and most convenient option, if the only option is plastic wrapped food, they will buy it.  \nI've also seen plastic bags being offered or the need for them assumed in rather ridiculous situations. For example, when buying one small item at a store, cashiers sometimes automatically put the item in a bag.  This is no fault of the cashier, as they are likely instructed to bag the item unless the customer refuses it (which I usually do), or are so used to bagging items that this is a habit.  However, some stores have now discontinued plastic bags altogether (looking at you, Superstore on Quinpool Rd. in Halifax!), or ask customers if they would like one.  I think that discontinuing plastic bags altogether would be the best option (its really not that hard to bring your own cloth bags, and they are much stronger anyway), but if this isn't an option, charging customers for the bags would be second best.\nIn all, I think the government and industry need to work on reducing the prevalence of plastic packaging and bags in stores.  If the option for plastic isn't right in front of our faces, we will be less likely to use it and will adapt.  First up should be going plastic bag free (including those flimsy produce bags!) and eliminating the plastic-wrapped produce and other foods that have absolutely no need for it. Perhaps promoting alternatives would be good too, such as cloth produce bags (which work great, but few people seem to know about them).",

The only plastics that should be manufactured at all are for medical\/life saving reasons or recycled items, to deal with the surplus of already-existing plastics that we need to utilize in some way.

If a plastic is unavoidable, I look for something that I will be able to reuse, or if not recycle. Unfortunately that is very hard in my community as far too little is recycled. \n\n2. Governments should institute a plastic tax on the large corporations that manufacture plastic and source it for their products. Taxing at the corporate level is a necessary first step.\n \n- Furthermore, there should be institutional incentives for small businesses and local communities to go waste free - think educational campaigns about removing plastic from grocery stores along with taxes on plastic bags (etc.)\n\n- there should be more support for bulk buying and \u201cbring your own container\u201d programs. Subsidies should go to local businesses that are waste free, allowing them to initially give consumers a discount when bringing their own container to fill and choosing to be zero waste as plastics are phased out of grocery stores and restaurants\/cafes. \n\n- plastic drinking straws are a huge problem that must be addressed. The average straw is only used for a few seconds and then ends up in landfills or waterways. Yet, as certain people with disabilities require these straws to be able to live, there need to be government funding\/programming to ensure that people that need straws to live have funding for adequate, sustainable products that work for them. For the rest of the population, take-out cups requiring straws should be phased out in favour of the straw-less cold cups (those with similar lids to the hot cups) \n\n- prices must be adjusted to ensure consumers begin to bring their own take out mugs and containers. Furthermore, the black plastic\/styrofoam take out containers must be phased out. They have no place in modern day canada. \n\n- All non-reusable and non-recyclable plastic should be heavily taxed at the production level, encouraging businesses to forgo waste in favour of a circular economy. Furthermore, businesses that produce plastic must help with recycling - whether it is by helping to fund the recycling program or by accepting container returns for refills, etc.",

I will choose biodegradable or reusable packaging, preferably no packaging at all, like bulk or zero waste grocery stores or farmer's markets. Governments should ban plastic bags and single use plastics such as straws, utensils, plates, styrofoam containers, bottles and require industry to develop more sustainable packaging solutions. Government needs to set high standards for industry to follow in terms of packaging, but also product design to end of life. Industry should adhere to the circular economy idea. For example, plastic bottles should be banned completely and glass used, returned and reused again as was the case before with industry responsible to take back the glass bottles, clean and reuse them (how things were done before the advent of plastic bottles). Planned obsolescence should not be allowed as a business model. Products should be reparable and of good quality to begin with. Car seats and breast pumps should be built to be either useable for a long time by different families or able to be taken apart and pieces reused if we are encouraged for single family use. I find it appallingly wasteful that these baby products can only be used once and then thrown away with the company taking no responsibility for the item after use (no recycling program). Government needs to regulate the clothing industry also if polymer fibres are polluting our oceans. Such fabrics should not be produced if they polllute in such a way. A lot of R&D needs to focus on sustainable products, packaging, but also more thought as to the longevity and reparability of products and how to handle end of life. Business models that don't operate this way or who depend on selling cheap products that breakdown quickly and go to landfill should not be in business.",

The best way to reduce plastic pollution is to move away from this material which, once produced, will never go away. Recycling is not a solution since there is no market for most used plastic and plastic is downcycled, not recycled, and will become trash at some point. \n\nPrevention is key: whenever possible, eliminate the use of plastic, or replace it with reusable or more sustainable materials.\nA couple of measure:\n- impose plastic bans (straws, plastic bags, single-use plastic takeout containers, single-use plastic cups, etc.) - this is effective but radical so might require some of the preliminary measures below:\n- put a price on single-use plastic to deter people from using them (often a preliminary step to a ban, e.g. for plastic grocery bags)\n- educate the public to encourage a switch to reusable items (a Canada-wide #NoExcuseForSingleUse campaign for example)\n- lead by example by banning single-use plastic from government buildings, cafeterias and events (no events with plastic cutlery and styrofoam plates and cups e.g.)\n- internalize the cost of plastic disposal like Ontario is planing on doing: producers should be paying for the disposal and recycling of plastic (right now, municipalities pay the biggest chunk of these costs, which creates no incentive for producers to reduce the use of plastic which, as we now, is quite cheap to produce).

            "comment": "1) I always go for the option with the least amount of plastic, but unfortunately plastic is virtually unavoidable. When grocery shopping for example, I don't bag vegetables individually, but throw them all into a reusable bag, however there will inevitably be plastic stickers on each individual item, plastic wrapped around carrots or leafy vegetables to bind them together etc... If I could I would avoid it altogether.\n\n2) The government needs to create repercussions for those who produce plastic - plain and simple. It's a cheap option, so producers will NEVER opt for a more expensive\/sustainable option. It's simply capitalism 101. There must be some sort of penalty\/tax. I'm really not interested in seeing plastic production reduced so much as eliminated - we have far more plastic than we should as is. Ultimately, I think moving towards banning plastic is a much more useful approach.",

I evaluate whether the other vendor is generalized enough that I can purchase all the items I need for that period of time in one place, or whether I need to go to several other providers. (I.e. I can purchase produce that isn't wrapped in plastic at a grocery store, but would need to go out of my way to a bulk retailer to purchase other staples in a reusable container, and vice versa). I have to evaluate whether I have time or resources to frequent multiple locations to get what I need in the most sustainable way.  \n2. Governments can create, support, and help popularize institutions and retailers that provide an accessible means of purchasing bulk food and other products with no plastic waste. While bulk food purchasing is slowly on the rise, there is a notable lack of options to purchase other items like shampoo, handsoap, oils, and even items like toilet paper or paper towels that inevitably always come wrapped in plastic. Zero-waste lifestyles must first be a more accessible, convenient, and easy option for people from all socio-economic backgrounds before it can be made a reality. A one-stop location to purchase most staples in bulk for a competitive price helps justify the extra effort to those who are less concerned about plastic waste.",

There are numerous cases of municipalities that have successfully banned plastic bags and their lead should be investigated for what works, what doesn\u2019t, and then implemented.

I also have issue with walking the street and seeing one time use coffee cups and lids, fast-food items and cigarette packaging that will never break down naturally, and has socially been accepted to throw away. \n\nWhile I understand we do not want to burden one industry with a trial activity, I feel we can go after some of these more frequently observed packaging issues using available and quickly biodegradable lids, straws, cigarette\/marijuana packaging, and food wrapping.",

I won't purchase something if it is a plastic container that can't be recycled, I'll find an alternative or I do without.\nb) Can I buy the same thing packaged in something other than plastic or not packaged at all (for example: there is a new company that sells yogurt in glass jars, now I won't buy the yogurt in plastic containers).  If the same thing comes packaged in glass, metal or paper I will choose that option even if it's more expensive. \nc) Can the plastic container be reused. If  I at least re-use that plastic container (for example Terra 20 will refill your plastic container of shampoo) I will consider the purchase.  \n\nI never put my produce in those plastic bags they provide at the grocery store, I leave it loose, put it in a paper bag (there are sometimes paper bags near the mushrooms, or I put it in my own reusable produce bag.  If I have the choice, I will always food packaged in a can or glass container.  \n\n2. Here's what can be done:\n\na- Education - Governments and industry can do a better job of educating people about what things can be successfully recycled.  This is not at all clear. There are too many different labels on plastic that the average consumer has no idea what plastic can actually be recycled.  \n\nb- Provide incentives to those company's that use alternatives to plastic. \n\nc - Issue penalties to company's who use plastic packaging that isn't recyclable or reusable. Reward company's who take responsablity for cleaning up the single use plastics they create. \n\nd - Governments and industry could provide incentives to individuals\/company's that come up with ways to reuse single use plastics.   Reward those who take initiative and clean up plastics from the environment.  Reward those individuals who want to go out and clean the plastic straws from the local beach or from the local park. \n\ne) Fund local think tanks that are dedicated to working with local companies to reduce their waste",

Do not allow grocery stores to sell plastics cups, plates, etc. Fast food needs to use biodegradable cups and packaging and allow people to bring reusable cups of all varieties.  However, this will still surface as waste and we need to work on stronger waste management with tougher fines for corporations. We need to remember that life functioned without plastic, we CAN convert back to quality longlasting products that CAN be reused to their full life.

Products should be made to be taken apart and most, if not all, of the materials should be used again.

I saw plastic bags all over the land at the bottom of South America where hardly anyone lives and my cousin saw lots of plastic bags blowing across the Sahara.  If plastic bags are a problem in these remote places how bad is it in the rest of the world.  Create new materials for packaging that are petroleum free and bio-degradable. I think the solution has to start with individuals refusing to use plastic as much as possible. There are lots of global movements trying to eliminate use of plastic and I wish them great success.  I personally have reduced my plastic use significantly and will continue to do so.",

            "comment": "I consider the health and environmental risks from plastic products, as well as how long they will be usable. For instance, household appliances, cell phone, computers, TVs etc should never be considered 'disposable' and only have a short life span. I still have my Grandmothers kitchen mixer and radio that were purchased in the 1930s, and they still work. Products today are designed to breakdown and be disposed of after a year or 2. Water, milk, and beverage containers are another huge problem. Let's go back to glass or cardboard cartons. I never buy eggs in plastic containers, only in cardboard, and I save those egg cartons for farmers in the area that sell eggs. Plastic shopping bags should be replaced with cloth or paper bags. And diapers! Let's ban disposables and go back to re-usable cloth. Think of how small a footprint your children would make if we did this, 24 to 36 cloth diapers that can be used until they wear out,  compared to 2500 to 3000 disposables in a single year per baby!",

            "comment": "1. In the last month I started the process of going plastic-free with an end goal of coming as close as I can to zero waste. It has been, so far, much easier than I anticipated and now I marvel that I was duped into thinking that I needed so many products that are harmful to the environment, possibly to my health and certainly to my bank account. \n2. I sincerely hope that the government will take real steps towards restoring a safe and healthy natural environment for future generations. I hope at the very least, that single-use plastic will become a relic very soon. Innovative uses for plastic and \"biodegradable\" plastics come with their own problems and more importantly, they do nothing to stop our waste from harming marine life.",

            "comment": "1) To be honest, I don't often think about the packaging of the product before I purchase it, but I often think about it after the packaging has been removed.\n\n-I have learned that it is very difficult to recycle black plastic\n-It is very hard to determine which plastics can be recycled and which cannot be recycled\n-It is distressing to see significant amounts of packaging get thrown away immediately. The packaging does its just but to a consumer, we only see it doing its job from store to home\n\nIn the future, I will consider the packaging's use once it has served its purpose (how can I reuse it in the home?), its ease of recyclability, and its overall cost.\n\n2) Here is a list of suggestions that I think will make it easier to evaluate plastics as a packaging material:\n- Educate the public on what the different plastics are, how are they recycled? why are they useful? \n- Like cigarette packaging, directly show the consequences of plastic waste on our local environment to consumers before they purchase a product\n- Find a way to disclose how much that packaging costs with respect to the cost of the product. \n- Provide opportunities for consumers to make better buying decisions by creating a place for consumers to evaluate similar products with alternative packaging (perhaps a database, website or app.)\n- Provide incentives to the public for following through on waste-reducing practices (i.e. Tax breaks for volunteering at local clean-up events)\n- Directly involve plastics manufacturers and consumer product makers in the discussion so that feedback can be passed from consumers to producers\n- Provide incentives to businesses who package their products responsibly (fiscal rewards, tax exemptions, etc.)",

I have found a deli that wraps its meat in paper.  At the fish counter in Thriftys, I tell them, \"No plastic.\" and they wrap the fish in paper.  I recycle many times the small plastics bags located in the produce section of Thriftys.  There is no reason why these bags cannot be used again and again for things like apples and carrots.  Perhaps customers should be charged for them as a way of a deterrent.  \nI am trying to purchase: soap, shampoo, laundry soap by bringing in my own plastic container for refill.  I would like to see this kind of refillable service expanded for these kinds of products.  Plastics straws are not necessary in most cases.  Reusable straws are available for people who need them.  That is it for now.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment.  Heather",

I buy baked goods that can be packaged in paper bags when I can.  However, in Fort McMurray, fresh baked goods from the bakery and a lot of fruit (berries etc..) come in clamshell packaging.  We don't have a lot of farmer's markets or fresh fruit vendors such that this can be avoided.\n\n2. Individuals can try to avoid plastic as per the above.  I do re-use some plastic packaging for packing lunches or starting garden seeds.  But most is sent to the recycle bin.   I believe government and industry should work towards minimal or locally recyclable or compostible packaging (like paper).  I think industry should be charged a fee for disposal for plastic packaging to encourage them to innovate around it. Customers won't like the price increase and industry will have to solve the problem to remain competitive.",

Often, I will choose a comparable item with less packaging or the item with compostable\/reusable packaging. If it comes to take out, I refrain from taking all the plastic that comes with the food items (bags, cutlery, straws,etc) \n\n2. There should be more strict regulations on packaging. Some items can simply do without the plastic upon plastic. The best solution would be to enforce compostable packaging. I\u2019m no expert in this process\/product, but as a consumer it can go into my compost. Even if people did throw it out, it would break down much more quickly than plastic. \n\nAdditionally, the government could offer tax rebates on electronic repairs. It seems it has become too easy in our society to just throw something away (think cell phone\/tv) and purchase a new one, rather than get the old one repaired. Food corporations should also be regulated or receive a tax refund for having sustainable practices, to entice them to make changes.

We should also ensure that community organic recycling can properly handle this standard, currently this is not the case in several (Calgary as an example).\n\nIn general, I feel that we should NOT send our recyclable plastic (like bottles) overseas for processing. This is just taking advantage of lower labor costs from people with a much lower standard of living and in countries with lower environmental regulations and enforcement. We should process all of our own recycling in Canada. I realize this puts extra cost into the system, but that is the cost that we have to burden.",

The following measures are suggested:\nBan plastic film that covers other packaging\nBan all plastic packaging\nPaper instead of plastic straws\nBeverages in glass or cans, no more plastic bottles!\nVegetable bags for grocery shopping\nBan plastic tooth brushes and Floss \nsticks\nBan all single use plastics\nDevelop method of recycling toys and other plastic household goods\n\nThe conversation is important, but execution of an action plan is vital. Our waste not only affects us but when it enters our oceans, other countries as well. Communities will need funding support to develop programs as well.\n\nLynn",

There's absolutely no need for things like toilet paper, kleenex, or soap to be wrapped in plastic.\n\nI'd also like to see more true zero-waste stores available, where you can buy everything from flour, to strawberries, to milk, to dish soap by bringing and filling your own container. Bulk Barn fills some of this need, but it doesn't go far enough.",

When you start to pay attention to this, it's amazing just how much single use plastics are using to wrap our vegetables and fruits.

I was in Italy a few months ago and was very interested in the fact that stores only use biodegradable bags now, the same kind we use now for our compost.  The bags can be made strong and durable to hold groceries or a few bottles of wine.  Canada needs to transition to this type of bag.",

            "comment": "I try to consider whether or not the plastic is single-use, however, most items we find in the stores nowadays are single-use plastics, so sometimes I really need to plan ahead and be sure to have my re-useable bag, make sure that I bring my own cutlery\/container, etc.  Unfortunately most of the plastic we buy is in fact, single-use, so to improve plastic products and extend their life would be to completely re-think policies on plastic production - because the vast majority is single-use.  And since it is hard to control what we do at an individual level, there need to be government policies in place to force companies to be responsible for the waste that their product-packaging produces.  Montreal just put in place a plastic bag ban, and different cities are banning, slowly, certain items (i.e. straws), which is a step in the right direction at least to raise awareness to the issue but also to send a message to large corporations that they need to become environmentally responsible.  \nI think we need our government to focus on a plan that is sustainable in the long-term, which can only mean a reduction in our dependency on single-use plastics and plastics in general (we can re-use a water bottle over and over, but we know from recent studies that microplastics still enter the water that we end up consuming). We can also extend the life of plastics, only to have them discarded in inappropriate ways, so again, I believe the solution lies with reducing our dependency on plastics.  Previous generations survived without so many plastic products, but it did mean a shift in waste-habits and it does require an uncomfortable look at the fact that we are convenience-based society where we would rather be wasteful than take the time to wash something and re-use it.  Government policy needs to do the unpopular work of making real sustainable change with such factors in mind.",

If it is single use, like a wrapper around a cucumber or herbs, I'm less likely to buy it, seeing as it has a very limited use. \n2. Governments can ban plastic that is not recyclable, refuse import of products unnecessarily wrapped in plastic, enforce grocery stores to only sell produce not wrapped in plastic. Like with the change of charging 5 cents for plastic bags, eventually people will bring reusable bags to put their produce in, if they feel they need it. This is how industry and individual also participate. Governments can give funding to those researching and producing recycled packaging products, like edible\/compostable packaging or things like pineapple leather.",

            "comment": "Q1) Avoiding plastic in all forms is a priority for me. So necessity is the key consideration when I buy: do I need it? If I do,  there's a decision-making tree for it. Can I reduce the amount of plastic inherit in it, or ensure reuse by using a more durable plastic item (weather-proof storage containers are an example in my case)? Last consideration is recycling. Having been involved in large scale recycling programs I don't feel it is the sole\/best solution given consumer confusion, fickle recycling markets and its potential to exhibit Jevons Paradox (some might argue recycling increases resource consumption, minimizing benefit). Important to point out necessity is connected to health and safety, which is a place there are legitimate challenges to curbing single use plastic (i.e. medical applications).\n\nQ2) I think regulation is required. I work in the event industry and we've seen success in introducing event-specific bans on items like plastic bags, polystyrene food serviceware and vinyl signs. I've also worked at event sites in the U.S. that ban things like balloons, straws and adhesive signs and have been required to put up a deposit to ensure we don't break these rules (eg. Oregon Convention Centre, City of SF plastic bag ban). This works because the event (or the venue) have control over what comes into the event site. Our challenge is that others aren't limited by the voluntary restrictions we place on our events and participants in them. So it costs us more to manage waste and participants feel inconvenienced by the 'rules' when they can have it easier elsewhere. So while I do believe there is a place for education, voluntary action and 'soft' tactics, for those trying to more aggressively reduce plastic waste in an environment that only promotes these tactics, it sure would help to have a more level playing field where others were held to some minimum rules, or material bans.",

J'essaie d'\u00e9viter le plastique que ma municipalit\u00e9 ne recycle pas (6). \n2-Il faudrait uniformiser les r\u00e8gles de recyclage d'une ville et d'une province \u00e0 l'autre. Surtout concernant le plastique. Il faudrait mieux informer la population sur les types de plastique. Les plastiques non-recyclable devraient \u00eatre banis des emballages alimentaires.Le deuxi\u00e8me enjeu prioritaire est celui du suremballage. Certains produits sont emball\u00e9s alors qu'ils n'ont aucun besoin d'emballage Ex. l\u00e9gumes et d'autres sont emball\u00e9s dans plusieurs \u00e9paisseurs de plastiques, cartons, de toutes sortes. Les commerces de vrac (et le vrac en \u00e9picerie) doit \u00eatre favoris\u00e9, mais on doit \u00e9galement rendre les sacs en filet, tissu, papier plus facilement disponible pour les clients. Il devrait \u00e9galement y avoir une loi obligeant les commerces de vrac et \u00e9piceries vendant des produits \u00e0 la coupe \u00e0 accepter les contenants propres sous peine d'amende. Le papier de toilette devrait \u00eatre emball\u00e9 dans du papier et id\u00e9alement fait de papier recycl\u00e9 (peu de compagnie en offre \u00e0 prix abordable). Je pense que le consommateur s'habituerait \u00e0 apporter certaines choses avec lui si celles-ci n'\u00e9taient pas fournies par les commerces. Les commerces pourraient aussi offrir une r\u00e9duction aux personnes qui apportent leur contenant ce qui pourrait encourag\u00e9 les gens \u00e0 le faire. Plus de cuisines collectives devraient naitrent ce qui permettrait l'achat en gros voir en vrac et donc moins de plastique. Cr\u00e9er des soir\u00e9es de quartier d\u2019\u00e9change de v\u00eatements et autres pour \u00e9viter la production de nouveau d\u00e9chets.

If I absolutely have to purchase an item wrapped in plastic I always make sure it is recyclable in my area (for instance #6 plastics aren\u2019t, so I always avoid those)\n\n2) I strongly believe the responsibility of reducing plastics in our environment should fall onto the industries and government and not so much on the individual. Some things are simply not available plastic-free and at that point there is nothing an individual can do if they need this type of product. \n- Accessibility to recycling is a huge factor! Some communities have different restrictions in regards to what can be recycled and what can\u2019t simply because of the available facilities. Not every community, especially rural ones, have the funds to access advanced recycling plants, this limits us in the amount of materials we can recycle. Additionally, many chains and retail stores have to pay for recycling themselves because the city or township does not pick up their recycling. For instance, I work in a pharmacy and the owner would have to spend additional money to have the recycling picked up. So he doesn\u2019t to cut down on costs. That means that all of the plastic vials used for medication are thrown in the trash and don\u2019t even have the opportunity to be recycled, which is heartbreaking. So the solution to this is making recycling accessible to everyone by aloting more funds to help cities, townships, and business owners to have access to recycling. Additionally recycling bins cost money in my township, people have to pay to get a recycling bin. Sometimes with some extreme gusts of wind or during winter storms we lose our recycling bins, they simply disappear from our curb side. We shouldn\u2019t have to pay to get another recycling bin; recycling should be accessible to everyone.\n- Some countries have begun establishing laws against plastic straws, I think Canada should follow in those footsteps. Plastic straws are a huge waste and contribute a large amount of plastic found in our waters.\n- While recycling is great, I strongly believe that eliminating the production of plastic to begin with is a far better option. We need to invest in research to engineer new materials that can be used in similar ways but have little to no environmental impact and can also be recycled.\n- I would also love to see more and more businesses offering opportunities for individuals to bring back old containers. LUSH is a good example, they sell many things in the same types of containers and if you bring back 5 of those containers you get a free face mask. The containers are already recyclable on their own but they offer an incentive for individuals to return the containers which helps them reduce on costs and materials (they can reuse containers and not spend money on making new ones). While businesses should already be inclined to do this because this allows them to cut on costs, many businesses don\u2019t offer this type of service. The reason behind this is unknown to me, reducing costs should be enough incentive for companies to adopt this method...\n- I also think that incentives should be given to businesses who have lower carbon footprints in order to encourage companies to ditch plastics and waste.\n- I also want to stress that so many things are packaged in plastic for \u201csanitary purposes\u201d. There is absolutely no need to have fruits and vegetables wrapped in plastics! If they\u2019ve already been washed by the producer and we then proceed to wash them at home, plastic is absolutely unnecessary.\n- Lastly one of the most important things is education. Taking the time to educate people about these issues is so important. So many consumers are absolutely clueless that any of these issues are going on. People know plastic is not good for the environment but they still go ahead and purchase it because *it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s recyclable\u201d. Reducing consumption is more important that investing in recycling. People need to be made aware of the impacts plastics are having on the environment so consumers can make better decisions when they purchase items. This could be drastic, but adding some type of warning label on anything wrapped in plastic (similar to warning labels on cigarette packs) might get people to think twice about the things they purchase. In the same train of though, not enough people know how to recycle and compost properly. Too much time and money is spent triaging things at the recycling plant that should never have wound up there in the first place. Recycle bins and compost bins could contain graphics and images on them to offer a visual reprenstation of what goes in which bin. Residents who don\u2019t properly recycle and compost their products should also be fined. The fines should be handed out by the person who picks up the garbage when they notice things haven\u2019t properly been sorted.",

            "comment": "Ban the use of plastic bags, straws and excessive food packaging. I think it is beyond just education, legislation is required. Have grants available to reward sustainable design. Fine people for not recycling properly. The contamination in blue boxes costs the municipality a fortune. Educate people to carry a water bottle, a reusable coffee cup ( I'm still guilty of forgetting) carry cloth or reused bags.\nMake homes for the homeless out of plastic. (It's a thing, really) and apparently cost effective. Roads can also be made from plastic.  Give tax breaks to environmentally sustainable industries and small businesses. Encourage hemp production for clothing over cutting trees and using cotton and fibres with micro-beads. Step up the education process like they do in Singapore with constant reminders on billboards etc.. I used to think that this was so big brother and it is on many levels but not when it comes to reducing plastic which is not only killing our rivers, oceans and wildlife but is killing us. We have an ecological crisis on our hands. I can hardly believe that 40 some odd years ago I did a photo essay on pollution in primary school. We have known for so long yet have turned a blind eye for profit and convenience. We are all guilty but it's never too late to make a difference. I won't eat takeout from restaurants that use Styrofoam. If we use our dollars to make a stand then industry will have to follow. However as mentioned above I think we also need government intervention. Thanks for listening Placespeak.",

I have an amazing diet now with no processed foods at all.  This has reduced packaging a great \ndeal. I don\u2019t need to buy soda water and  recycle bottles. Instead we make our own soda water with a soda stream. \n\nI would buy decomposable hemp derived plastics every chance I could if they were available. \n\nI prefer natural fibres in clothing and in household linens. \n\nDe-incentivize purchase of single use products like ziplock bags and fast foods from restaurants with a hefty tax. Use these tax dollars to start a reusable container program featuring silicone for food safety and hemp for its ability to go back to nature. Find other packaging solutions that use sustainable resources and are compostable. Give incentives to businesses that find the best ways and the best systems.",

            "comment": "I try to avoid buying over packaged products, as do most of the posters on this consultation, but it's hard. As a result I think the government needs to bring in legislation and compliance monitoring. \n\nThere should be incentives, tax rebates, or other promotions to encourage the manufacturers to either use less plastics in their packaging, use biodegradable material, ensure that their packaging is universally recyclable (e.g.made with one component, don't put plastic windows on boxes or bags, don't mix plastic types in your packaging, etc.)\n\nWith legislation and programming, there needs to be compliance auditing. To enable this I think the manufacturers and the users need to pay. For the manufacturers it could be a per-item fee. For the users\/purchasers, there should be deposits. I know when I lived in Alberta when you bought a 2L plastic pop bottle you had to pay a deposit fee. When you returned it to the recycling facility you received money back. When I came to Ontario, this was not and it's still not the case.  The Ottawa store Farm Boy is great because they have their own program like this. You can buy milk in a glass bottle and you pay a deposit fee which is returned when you return them the empty bottle.",

Education has gone a long way to get friends to change their habits.  I always carry a fold up reusable bag in purse, a swell Water bottle in my purse and also use a refillable coffee up. Therefore never go to Mc Donald\u2019s for coffee because they do not refill. I NEVER buy water in plastic bottles. Today I was going to by a quick BBQ Chicken and put it back because it was in black plastic container which is not recyclable in Toronto. I also use net bags for produce and do not use the plastic produce bags.\n\nGovernment - outright ban in plastic bags. I\u2019m disgusted with these things flying around and getting caught in trees, seen in water ways etc. So many alternatives available.\nMunicipalities that cannot recycle items such as black plastic, small municipalities some do not except styrofoam. Then these items need to be banned.\nProvinces ie Ontario need a plastic bottle deposit program, only 2 provinces don\u2019t have this. \nIndustry - Pepsi and others still use plastic ring connectors when biodegradable options are out there or for 6 cans why not wrap in cardboard box. I saw this done with small cans of tomatoes juice.\nIndustry - get away from plastic bottles. I saw at the Ripley Aquarium \u201cwater in a box\u201d.\nSo much more can be done, just look at what is occurring around the world!\nIndustry needs to steps up in a big way and make changes rather than producing all this plastic. \n\nA massive education plan needs to be done at all levels on Government.\n- The litter in general not just water ways, but roadsides, sidewalks, parks everywhere is disgusting. \n- Encourage schools to have litterless lunches. \n\nThat\u2019s all for now.",

For example, I will not buy berries, cherry tomatoes, etc., in the plastic boxes.  I will only buy them if I can place them into my own reusable, produce bag.  If I am buying shampoos, detergents, etc., I buy from stores where I can return and refill the bottle with that product.  Fortunately, in the city I live in (Ottawa), there are several grocery stores that allow me to reduce my plastic consumption and a few stores where I can bring in my own containers and bottles to be refilled.\n\n2)  Single use plastic just needs to banned and replaced with something biodegradable.  Things like straws, creamers, coffee cups, plastic grocery bags, etc., are very unnecessary especially since there are already alternatives available.  It would be great to see governments provide more funding\/grants for companies supplying plastic free products, or stores that are zero waste.  \n\nIt's also very confusing from municipality to municipality what the recycling and compost rules are.  Why can't it just be improved and standardized?",

            "comment": "You could create a colour coded system on plastics to extend their lifetime by knowledge. For example , black takeout containers from the grocery store or deli could have the clear lids tinted with blue. McDonalds cups have a blue band down the side, or Tim Hortons lids have a blue stripe. This would be a simple colour system as a reminder that plastics can be washed and reused (yellow) or recycled (blue) or disposable (red). This could help customers also in making choices and facilitating producers to want to use better packaging. In my fridge the lettuce, cheese, veggie dogs and milk- all wrapped in plastic with colours. This additional colour symbol wouldn\u2019t be hard to add to existing designs. This could also be disclosed as to how many products were produced with various coloured symbols. The small triangle imprint doesn\u2019t do justice. I\u2019m my opinion, you should be able to still get a quick cup of coffee in a cup, considering people work and are on the go. In saying that there must be better, consistent systems that people can easily catch on to.",

            "comment": "The supermarket is the first place to look at - more and more places are eliminating their bulk sections, when in fact everything should be available in bulk. I highly encourage a \"take back\" container system which can be in effect with supermarkets or implemented in cities. This would mean having distribution centres (like coffee shops, grocery stores, etc) supply glass or tin containers, which can be used, and then returned back to any facility accepting these within the city or grocery store chain for proper sanitation. This eliminates the 'sanitary' issues associated with people bringing their own containers, and this way families don't need to keep track \/ get confused with their recycling. Places that accept containers for sanitation need to be well-distributed to make things convenient for the customers, and it could be profitable and feasible by \"buying in\" to the program as a sort of rental concept, with a larger up-front cost that acts as a deposit if containers are not returned.\n\nThere should also be a government mandate that all plastics should be recyclable, or that convenience items already packaged in plastic be biodegradable. If not, we need better centres for recycling.\n\nAlso, imposing a tax on excessive plastic packaging (for example, in takeout containers) would be wildly helpful in aiding lesser-packaged items gain market share.",

Except for exceptional cases, things such as plastic straws, plastic cutlery, plastic plates, etc., are unnecessary. In the case of things such as straws, it should just be an easy switch - you likely don't use a straw for your glasses at home, so why are they needed at restaurants or bars? In the case of things such as the plastic plate your pizza comes on, a cultural shift will be needed. It would be easy to get some cheap glass plates for a store, with people returning their glass plates to a bin when they are done (think college cafeteria style). This is a more difficult behavior to start, but one that isn't that difficult for consumers to do, and not that expensive for companies up front.",

            "comment": "1) if a non-plastic alternative is suitable, available, and comparable in cost, I will buy it.  I avoid single use plastics like straws and shopping bags by bringing my own reusable (albeit still polyester...) shopping bags and asking for no straw when it seems obvious that everyone gets one, though I could do better with things like takeout food containers and to-go coffee cups\/lids.  I bought stainless steel straws to use at home (for smoothies, the kids prefer to drink with a straw) but only one kid likes them, the other complains that they taste funny (I disagree) and so currently we are using the rest of the plastic straws that I have in my pantry anyways (but will be looking for a non plastic alternative once they're gone).  We also avoid \"CPC\" (cheap plastic crap) that often breaks shortly after buying\/receiving, and clutters up the home before it goes to clutter up the local Value Village and then eventually landfill. We do our best to take care of the items that we own so that they will last longer and not need replacing\/throwing away as early\/often.  We could do better at speaking up to retailers where non-plastic alternatives are not available, especially for things we buy regularly.\n\n2a) \nREDUCE: We should find a way to pass this cost on to the producers who opt to make, package, and sell items made of plastic or items contained in plastic.  If using plastic unnecessarily cuts into their bottom line, they will make changes.  If they opt to just pass on the expense, the true cost of plastic will be more obvious and the market will come up with cheaper, non-plastic alternatives\nREUSE: We also need to make it easier to re-use plastic and other items.  If I receive items packaged in bubble wrap when shopping online, for example, I would love to be able to donate the bubble wrap for reuse maybe at my local post office, where someone else could take it for free instead of having to buy a bag of it.  This kind of reuse program would have to be accessible and easy to use for it to work.\nRECYCLE: Our area has done a great job lately educating residents what can\/cannot be recycled and why using the What Goes Where app and social media posts.  Don't make it complicated, don't make it mysterious.  Educate the public both on the impacts plastic has (I have to assume that the news stories out there just aren't sinking in) and how they can make a difference.\n\n2b)\nI've had to throw away so many items that should have lasted longer, but didn't, because some key part was made of plastic instead of a more suitable (metal, usually) material.  I don't know if that can be regulated in some way.  Things used to be made to last.  Now things are made to be thrown away.  Often a purchased item will come with a label saying \"no consumer servicable parts\".  Why not?  Consumers should be able to service items they own.  Encourage fix-it groups in neighbourhoods where people can share knowledge, tools, and ideas on how to make things better.  Make quality items more accessible.  Perhaps subsidies are needed especially for those that can only afford the cheapest option of a thing.",

The Liberal leader showed promise that inspired hope in many, but seems to have become bogged down in trying to pander to too many diverse interests. His best hope at this point is to listen to his heart and take principled, decisive action that will ensure a decent future for his kids and ours.

In terms of waste, the federal government needs to be more strict in what kinds of packaging are allowed and also how much packaging. It is ridiculous that small products have much more packaging that what is required. It is an attempt to market better, but it has the opposite appeal to me as a consumer because I will avoid a product with excessive packaging.  In terms of what is done at the other end, when done with the product, waste incineration should absolutely not be allowed or encouraged. EVER. There is no magic box that makes waste disappear. It either ends up in our airshed (landfill in the sky), where it cannot be contained, deposits on our crops, livestock and ecosystems, in our bodies or toxic ash. Contrary to the industry propaganda, it does not avoid landfill as the ash ends up there. If we do better at true recycling and reduction, composting, we can send less to the landfill at the end than the toxic ash from an incinerator. Plus, incineration encourages waste as it needs the feedstock.",

            "comment": "(1) The main factor I consider when purchasing items containing or made from plastic is whether there are alternatives.  For instance, if I need tomatoes, I consider whether my local grocery store sells tomatoes that are not packaged in plastic, and I choose those.  \n\n(2) What can governments, individual or industries do:\n\n- I really think we need to take the burden off individuals to address plastics waste.  I know it is politically palatable to encourage individuals to 'take action' on their own and write to their local retailers about reducing plastic packaging, etc.  But I am not convinced there are enough willing individuals to make a real difference in this issue.  Excessive plastics use and waste has been a problem for nearly four decades, and individual action has made little-to-no impact.\n- Even as an eco-conscious individual, there are so many larger factors out of my control that affect my ability to use fewer plastic products.  For instance, I can't make the decision to purchase food contained in single-use plastics if there isn't a convenient alternative offered to me (e.g. if I need tomatoes for a recipe and my local grocery store does not sell unpackaged tomatoes or tomatoes in compostable containers).  Even if I take the extreme, inconvenient measures to avoid single-use plastics (e.g. never buying products packaged in plastic, refilling containers at the rare stores that allow for refills, not buying products I want\/need because they are overpackaged...), the large, large majority of other individuals have demonstrated they are not be willing to take these measures.  Because the environmental price of plastics is currently NOT factored into their cost, they remain artificially cheap and convenient.  The large majority of consumers therefore respond to these price signals i.e. they will continue to buy and discard unnecessary plastics because the overt cost to them is much lower than the cost of the inconvenience associated with avoiding plastics in the current economy.\n- I strongly believe that GOVERNMENTS (in partnership with INDUSTRY) have a responsibility to take the lead on these difficult issues, on behalf of the public good.  The current issues with plastics overuse, plastics waste, and plastics pollution is due to market failure.  It is the role of government to address market failure.  Governments have a wide range of tools to do so, such as environmental levies\/taxes, trade policy, public education, and regulation.  I strongly encourage government (you) to use these tools to protect the public good.\n- I understand that a key barrier in addressing plastics-related issues is respecting Canada's commitments to international trade agreements i.e. not creating non-tariff trade barriers via plastics policies and regulations.  If you decide such trade barriers are required to reduce plastics waste, I strongly support you in prioritizing reduced plastics use\/waste these difficult negotiations with our international partners.\n- I expect one of the the best policy tools for reducing plastics use and waste is implementing producer take-back legislation\/regulation, in the spirit of 'cradle-to-cradle' sustainable production and consumption.  I am disappointed the federal government has taken so little action to implement producer take-back legislation over the past few decades.  I strongly urge you to use this policy tool now to reduce plastics use and waste.  \n- History has shown that relying on individuals to fix this problem does not work. Of all players involved, governments have the greatest power AND RESPONSIBILITY to reduce plastics use and waste on behalf of Canadians.  PLEASE start doing your part.",

We are forced to purchase what they supply.\n-all produces should be in biodegradable packaging. BUT if they are, they should be marked clearly.\nRecycling could be a lucrative and inventive business. \nWe have lost our leverage as a Country when it comes to Canada's control of production.\nWe need incentives as a Nation.",

Take away containers we repurpose for homemade soups, stews and meals that we prepare and freeze for lunches.  2.  What can government do?  Well, recognizing different jurisdictional issues, the Government of Canada could impose an envrionmental fee on any company using plastic packaging, and included in the law that it would be illegal to pass the cost of that fee\/tax on to consumers in the form of higher prices.  The government could impose tariffs on products entering Canada that make extensive use of plastic wrapping - 'extensive' would need to be defined.",

When is it the packaging producer's responsibility to provide recyclable material to contain their goods? When does it become the retailer's responsibility to provide their goods in recyclable packaging?  Why on earth (pardon the pun) must we buy meat that is on Styrofoam trays that go straight to the garbage?  So our meat doesn't tilt and drip?  Ludicrous!

Having said that, I opt for non-plastic when I have a choice of paper or cardboard, again, to keep plastic out of the environment. Plastic packaging only benefits the manufacturer, and I believe it must be banned. Why place the burden on government and citizens? Place the burden exactly where it belongs - the source. \n\nHere in Victoria, BC, soft plastic shopping bags have are slowly being banned. Yet what about all that soft plastic wrapping that grocers use to package its products? We all know it is in the grocers' interests to package products in strategic ways to require customers to purchase pre-determined numbers of or weights of product. One blatant strategy is to package fresh meat in pieces of 3 - which forces the customer to purchase two packages to feed 4 people. Banning this practice will return the choice to customers in terms of how many or how much of a product they actually want. \n\nIt's time for public policy to consider its citizens' and environmental needs before it bows to the lobbying efforts of commercial businesses.",

            "comment": "I try to avoid items made of plastic if better alternatives exist (items in glass, refillables, made from renewables).\nGovernments can ensure all products are regulated as part of Extended Producer Responsibility programs. Governments can ensure that these programs put a heavy emphasis on redesign and reduction of plastic items, can ask programs to put differential fees on products that reflect the full life cycle costs of materials to encourage better design and better products. Governments can require mandatory warranties, ensure that repair and parts are available for a designated time and put in place policies to reduce planned obsolescence of products. Governments can also ban problematic kinds of packaging (like multi laminates, expanded polystyrene, etc) and single use items (plastic straws, single use bags, styrofoam takeout containers). Governments can work to make it easier to have refillable containers, bring in ones own take out containers or have system for universal refillable coffee cups, take out containers, beverage containers, etc. Individuals can make their own choices but governments can take a closer look at policies that make it harder to do the right thing (some health laws, laws that needed liquor in a bag, etc). Industries can copy those in the UK where they sign on to reducing their use of plastic.  At the same time, we need to ensure that the switch is not just from plastic but to the use of renewable materials and for items that are not just as wasteful of the materials (instead for long lasting, multi-use).",

We need to support these with a wholesale change over to compostable options for takeout containers, cutlery, packaging, clamshells etc.  There are compostable options for all these things.  They may cost a fraction of a cent now, but that price will come down with volume.  I see a time when 60% of our waste will be organics (with no consumer confusion, or contamination).  Stuff will just all be compostable, or recyclable.  This is doable.  Lets phase it in, one stream at a time over 10 years.  The benefits far outweigh the negatives.",

We need to ban plastic grocery bags, including the little clear ones used for produce and excess produce packaging. These can be replaced with our own reusable bags and paper bags can be provided in case people need them. Plastic straws need to be banned because they're not recyclable in most cities and they are unnecessary. We need more biodegradable plastics (made from corn, hemp etc.) and we need more recycling capabilities so that more plastics can be recycled into new materials.",

            "comment": "I think the most important thing is to EDUCATE the public on sustainability and ENCOURAGE participation. Most simply do not understand the implications of our consumer habits, perhaps do not care, or do not consider the convenience of over-consumption and single use plastics to be something that they can part with. We need better public education on this issue, and it needs to also be present in restaurants and stores. Earlier this week, I brought my jars to Bulk Barn as I have been doing since the program recently started. They were holding a promotion for Earth Day, and gave me an extra 15% off my purchase for bringing my own containers. If more retailers (and especially fast food restaurants and coffee shops) offered something like this, it might encourage more people to routinely carry reusables. If plastic shopping bags at the grocery store cost a nickel (an amount that is too low to be significant deterrent), then that same nickel should be deducted if the customer has their own reusable bag. This could tackle the idea that charging too much for plastic bags would negatively affect low-income shoppers: if people could earn a few cents or a dollar towards their purchase, wouldn't that make it easier to discourage the use of plastic bags?",

Because we don't see them, we tend to stop talking about them but they are entering the bellies of most fish and then we are even eating them! And these cannot be collected and cleaned from our waters like larger pieces of plastic (bottles, bags etc.). Because everyone owns synthetic clothing and washes it, I think we should be working to install microplastic filters in all washing machines in Canada. Companies that have invented microplastic proof washing bags are helping, but to make a real, lasting impact here, we need to make the appropriate technology available to the masses. I can't just stop washing my clothes!",

Individuals can also re-use single use plastics as an option. There should also be legislative requirements to have a clear labeling of recyclable plastics and work towards standardized recycling. Plastics that are recyclable vs non-recyclable vary across municipalities and can confuse consumers on whether it is recyclable in a particular place or not. This confusion can lead to contamination and reduced diversion rates. Packaging should also be returnable to the business or retailer as oftentimes it can be reused for other products. \nGovernment should also tie single-use plastic with health and they contain chemicals that are interacting with our food especially in warmer weather. There also needs to be education campaigns after implementing changes to make consumers aware of such initiatives and reasons for it.",

However, many of the plastic containing items do not meet the requirement for reusing, so I have to recycle them (if the container is purely plastic), or dispose them (if the container has aluminium and other coatings in it). As result, the plastics with coating are going to the landfills, which is not a suitable place for plastic because it takes approximately 500 years to decompose naturally.\n\n2. The supermarket corporations have to give small discounts on bought products when bringing the corporation\u2019s barcoded reusable bag. Whenever the shoppers bring their own bags, the cashiers can scan the codes and update the number of times that the shoppers have reused the same bag since first bought. The more the reused time, the more free gifts, rewards or discounts the shoppers can earn or get. Nonetheless, since this is a temporary solution to reduce plastic wastes, we have to find another material that is durable, flexible, reliable and biodegradable.",

A certification for \"minimal packaging suppliers\" or similar will tell people that when they get the item they ordered it will not have more waste products than product. It will make them a preferred supplier to many and should boost profits. To get this certification, the company should have to verify that they have done their best to ship responsibly. For example, using paper, cloth, or compostable plastic bags; real popcorn instead of styrofoam peanuts (you can feed popcorn to the birds later); prepaid envelopes for non-recyclable packaging return; recycle symbols on all plastics, etc. This can be voluntary or better still, regulated. I also like the idea I read in an earlier post to have micro-plastic filters on washing machines.

            "comment": "I thank our government for this platform to expound on a very important topic. I hope someone is reading it.\n\nI suspect most readers of my comments will be unhappy with my observations. I provide them only to encourage an understanding of what I think are the big issues at play in this topic.\n\nI understand that we consume over 90 million barrels of oil a DAY plus a similar amount of coal and other hydrocarbons. Of that, about 1\/3 of the oil is converted into products like plastics. The focus of most of the discussion postings on this forum is on a minuscule portion of that; maybe the proverbial visible tip of the iceberg but still not significant.\n\nBecause carbon is such a 'flexible' atom, it ends up in many molecular combinations such as plant and animal cells; and of course long chain molecules we call plastics. Many years ago when I was personally involved in the plastics industry, there were 4,000 different plastics. To talk about plastics in the generic sense is like discussing how we should cook 'food', (i.e. not really very useful). \n\nBecause plastics are very new, man made products, nature has not had enough time to develop biodegradable processes that it has for cellulose, and other, ancient organic materials. Yet I am absolutely convinced that this will happen because plastics contain 'stored' energy and are hydrocarbon based so can be reconfigured into usable hydrocarbon based lifeforms.\n\nIn support of this hypothesis, I understand that, according to and article in scientific journals and the Globe and Mail, an enzyme has been discovered in Japan and is being enhanced by researchers in labs at Harvard and other universities that will decompose plastics back into short chain molecules which then can be further reprocessed by existing lifeforms into biologically useful molecular structures. As we all know, \"Nature abhors a vacuum\" so it will not let this energy source go unused. However, a natural recycling process could take some time to evolve without human help.\n\nI have read many of the earlier comments. The thread I see running through them is the 'cost' plastics impose on our world. The comments ignore why we enjoy the functionality of plastics and their benefits to our existing lifestyle; they were not 'imposed' on us. We chose to use them. \n\nPlastics were developed and are used for many reasons, but mainly because of the fact that they DO NOT DECOMPOSE\/CORRODE! Thus we need to expend time, energy and economic wealth to remove them from the biosphere. Would we not have the same problem with paper, wood, metals, cotton, wool, etc. if they did not decompose\/corrode? Because Mature has solved the recycling process for these 'older' products, we don't need to do anything about processing them at the end of their economic life cycle.\n\nSo until we either reject the benefits conferred by plastcis in it's many forms, we must set up a recycling process until Nature takes over (which, fortunately, it usually does once sufficient product is available). \n\nRecycling plastics is a complex, labor intensive and uneconomic process. Anything we individually and collectively do to voluntarily assist the process is useful, but probably ineffectual, until we convert plastics into another less stable  product in our environment. Of course, when this occurs, it will immediately cause us to look for a plastic replacement product because of our need to perform certain tasks now being done by plastics; thus restarting the whole cycle once again.\n\nAnyway, that is how I see it!\n\nJim Knock",

As a citizen with no direct ties to these organizations, the blue print outlines basic and a pragmatic approach to tackling Plastic pollution especially around how it impacts our oceans.  In addition, I would also propose that the government work with Industry and create legislature that would create accountability with the Plastic producers in Canada on creating a circular economy regarding the creation of plastic products and how we deal with them in their current form at end of life.  Plastics have become an integral useful product in our society but with over 4,000\/+ types of plastics and blends there needs to be some form of accountability that the plastics that are created can be recycled back into the system there by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.  We add  coloring to plastics, add additives to help extend product life, and create oxo degradeable plastics that are either non recyclable or simply breakdown into Micro plastics that are currently never eliminated from our environment.  The industry needs to be held accountable that any product created has an end of life strategy and can enter back into the work stream as a re-recyclable, re-usable product.

            "comment": "1. I generally try to reduce the packaging of products where possible, including by buying products that have no packaging, have returnable packaging (e.g., bottle deposits), or packaging that can be reused by refilling it at the store. I also try to avoid acquiring disposable plastic bags when shopping. Unfortunately, I find that often products are unnecessarily covered in lots of packaging. An example in the produce section in supermarkets is fruit or vegetables packaged in a combination of styrofoam and cellophane, neither of which can even be recycled in Ottawa, and both of which are unnecessary. Also, it is often difficult to buy organic produce without plastic packaging.\n\n2. As a solution for governments to reduce plastic waste, I suggest that plastic waste can be priced similarly to carbon. The concept is simple - it's a cost to all of us (and the environment) to have all of this plastic waste. Why not internalize that cost into the price of any product that contains plastic. I think disposable plastic bags should cost something like $1 each, for example, and non-recyclable styrofoam take-out trays the same. I think with that type of bold course of action, which would be the cost-effective approach recommended by most economists, we will see a very rapid shift in behaviours at the industry and consumer level. Recyclable plastic containers could all have a deposit, just like a glass milk bottle, of perhaps $1 or $2 dollars. Sure, it would take some money and effort to organize, but this should be funded by the industry and consumers who are perpetuating the generation of this plastic waste; not taxpayers at large.",

It would be an interesting concept to have grocery stores sell everything in bulk where nothing is packaged and people could fill up re-useable containers with the amount of food that they want. However, there are potential issues with this in terms of preservation and cleanliness, but it could be possible for a decent portion of products. \nAs for items containing or made of plastic, they should all be recyclable. A big issue however are products made of a combination of different substances such as plastic as well as paper or fabrics. These types of products confuse consumers in terms of whether they are recyclable or not, if they should be taken apart first before recycling etc. \nIndividuals should try to use less plastic and opt for items that aren't unnecessarily packaged in a bunch of plastic. They should also educate themselves on recyclable items and what needs to be done in order for items to be recyclable (eg. washing plastic containers before putting them in the blue bin). Governments should encourage industries to use less plastic packaging or to only use biodegradable packaging somehow... either by offering incentives or implementing fines\/taxes of some kind.",

SOMETIMES PLASTICS ARE THE BEST OPTION WHEN ALL THINGS ARE CONSIDERED.\n\nWhat can governments, individuals or industries do to:\nreduce plastic waste, and improve plastic products and packaging to extend their life?\nPRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS DEFINE WHAT PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED. GOVERNMENTS CAN AND SHOULD REGULATE AND ENCOURAGE COST-EFFECTIVE OPTIONS. THEY ALSO HAVE THE POWER TO EDUCATE AND, THAT FAILS, RESTRICT AND ENCOURAGE PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS TO CHANGE THEIR DECISION PROCESSES TO MEET A SOCIAL 'GOOD'. OF COURSE, GOVERNMENTS CAN FAIL IF THEY DEVIATE TO MUCH FROM ACTIONS THAT BENEFIT THE GENERAL SOCIAL WELL-BEING.\n\nREDUCING WASTE IS A POSITIVE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FORCE BY ANY MEASURE. IT IS DYSFUNCTIONAL TO PRODUCE UNNECESSARY WASTE. THUS WE ALL ARE DYSFUNCTIONAL WHEN WE PRODUCE WASTE AND THUS ARE IN NEED OF EDUCATION TO CORRECT OUR ACTIONS.\n\nIN SYSTEMS THEORY, THERE ARE NO WASTES, ONLY INPUTS AND OUTPUTS. WASTE IS JUST AN UNDESIRABLE OUTPUT.\n\nJim Knock",

Single serve or convenience items such as ready make salads, roast chicken etc are, in my opinion, the greatest contributors to our plastic problem. This is linked to families and individuals not having enough time to take care of their health and spending time making meals from bulk items. We live in a culture where spending time valuing food and health are not a priority. \n\nGovernments can require companies only package food in bulk and provide education on meal prep and saving money by purchasing this way. Industries and government should partner with researchers\/scientist to fund research on cleaner oil extractions, alternatives to plastic.\nIndividuals can make a conscience effort to not purchase in plastic if possible and re-use any if possible.",

It was good soil, but it contained all sorts of tiny bits of plastic that could not be screened out.  That opened my eyes.  There was likely additional plastic to that which I could see -- in the form of invisible microscopic bits.  For example, many \"paper\" teabags are made with plastic to reinforce them.  How many of these get tossed in the kitchen compost bin?  What about the little stickers on fruit: is it the law that they all be fully compostable?  Eventually, all those tiny plastic pieces will make up a significant proportion of our soil.",

I grow grapes and make jam in canning glass jars. I do sometimes store in plastic freezer bags, but I always reuse those bags for another purpose.  I avoid buy small packages of things. I use cardboard boxes and bring my own bags to grocery stores. I often will not put fruits in plastic bags preferring to let them be loose. I avoid buying prepackages salads unless I am really rushed. I occasionally go to farmers markets...I plan to do that more often.  I one year belonged to a farmer box program of getting vegetables every week but our garden is so productive....I had too much produce. I try to do my own home baking rather than buy from a store\nI believe the government needs to take a very active role to reduce plastic waste\nNontoxic and non plasticized cardboard boxes, used to bring food into the store, should be reused for grocery carry out ( This eliminates manufacturing more plastic type reusable bags, now being used).   \nEvery citizen should be encouraged to keep a home garden and perform home baking instead of buying packaged fruits and vegetables and packaged baking\nEverything presently sold in packages like milk, water, juice, soft drinks, sugar drinks, yogurt etc could be dispensed into glass, durable plastic or ceramic containers that customers bring from home(or from the grocery store where they are returned for washing and reusing)\nAll baked goods could be delivered to the ceramic or glass containers or durable plastic that customers bring from home\nAny clothing or material made from polyester or nylon or any other plastic material must exceed 100,000 rubs or more perhaps 400,000(i.e. very durable and long lasting).  But when possible, government should mandate the use of clothing from hemp, or linen or other types of natural fibres, where durability of the fabric is mandated,(no more of these acid washed\/sandwashed , damaged fabrics) \nCovers for items for sale should be made of washable fabrics that are reused, not plastic wraps or throw away plastic boxes\nThis would require law and laws with teeth\nThere are all of laws for things that are far less important than this issue. What can be more important than the fertility of our soil and the viability four water?",

Most plastics products are made from plastic because they use less energy and save on emissions during the manufacturing process.  Nobody wants excess packaging, but we also want the sanitary and safety benefits from the plastic package.  So let's incentivize recycling instead of banning materials that are beneficial.  \n What individuals can do is become better educated about the cost\/benefits of switching materials. Going back to heavy glass containers would have a big environmental cost just to make people feel better about not using plastic.  And let's find a way to hold each other accountable for littering.  Plastics by the roadside isn't something anybody wants, but we need support from governments in the form of education and promotion to remind us that we need to recycle plastics, not throw them out the car window.",

The easiest would be a simple $\/kg fee. The funds for pay would be paid by the plastics producers, manufacturers and fabricators who create and utilize plastics to sell to consumers, directly or indirectly. \n\nThe moral justification for the concept is the same as for existing waste recovery systems.\n\nThe beauty of it is it uses economic levers rather than coercive action to achieve compliance.\n\nI do not understand why it has not been done before now. \n\nIt could even be a mechanism that would result in major companies that would recover and remove (essentially 'mine') existing plastics now circulating in the world's oceans. \n\nThe associated administrative structure needed to create such an operational framework would be orders of magnitude smaller than would be required to enforce modification of individual behavior with respect to plastic waste reduction and recycling.\n\nAnother side benefit is plastics are hydrocarbons so contain stored solar energy which could be recovered relatively easily using current technologies.\n\nAgain, please explain to me why we are not doing this if the problem is as serious as stated in current media?\n\nJim Knock",

I will pay more for environmentally friendlier packaging.\n\nGovernment at the Provincial or Federal level needs to get involved more.  Ban plastic straws, only permit recyclable plastic packaging from all sources including imported goods.  More research on alternative packaging.  Local gov'ts, local organizations ( shout out to Fort St. John's NEAT organization) and businesses are the leaders in recycling.  \n\nSome products are made of types of plastics that are far too weak (tools, hardware etc) and have little durability while other one time use plastics are more robust -what gives? I guess if you break it more often more items needs to be produced for a sustainable economy !  Some products are made of plastic and metal where the plastic portion is used more and susceptible to breakage-disappointing when there is no alternative.  Have a high content of recycled plastic content in packaging or whatever it takes to keep last if out of landfills,the lakes,rivers,oceans and being ignorantly discarded into the general,environment.\n\nIt pains me that we have to import such things as plastic cups from the other side of the world instead of recycling and manufacturing those items in our own country.  We would save on transportation pollution and create jobs.\n\nIt is very troubling that toothpaste (Colgate) and deodorant (Gillete) companies add polypropylene beads to their products which end up in our waterways and in our bodies.  I suppose no one at those companies gave a second thought about the plastic pollution it would create.  They all probably have \"we care about the environment\" corporate statements but when it came time to capitalistic cash that went by the wayside.\n\nWe all need to reduce our consumption of goods and that would start to make a difference.  Remember someone will always try to sell you something you or we don't need and ends up being detrimental to the environment.",

Paper, wood, silk, cotton, linen, wool, feathers will compost eventually; glass is endlessly recyclable. I avoid plastic whenever I can, including oil-derived fabrics and poly fill.\n\nIn practice this means I've moved away from shopping at big box grocery stores as often as I used to, and instead hit my local main street: I take stainless steel containers to the butcher & deli for meats & cheeses and milk in glass bottles (which are returnable); health food store or Bulk Barn for pasta, beans, grains, nuts; greengrocer for fruits & vegetables (the owners will fill my reusable bags from stock in the backroom if the produce on display is wrapped in plastic). The result--more relationships in my community and less garbage. I'm not aiming for perfection, and we still fill our recycling bin and still use plastic. But it's better. I've also found my produce stays fresh longer in glass than it used to in plastic--especially herbs and leafy greens.\n\nI agree with another commenter that reusable produce bags need to be more widely available in grocery stores. That's such an easy step--so why aren't grocery chains already doing it? It seems manufacturers and big retailers almost never think about their environmental impact. The overpackaging of everything feels ridiculous, depressing, and often frustrating--try unboxing a (plastic) toy these days. Our school's earth day cleanup was eye opening--there was just so much of it, and it was all plastic. I'd like to see more of the cleanup, environmental, and health costs of plastic put back on those manufacturers and retailers, through taxes on plastic packaging AND incentives for reducing packaging. \n\nI would totally support a ban on single-use plastics in Canada.\n\nFinally, my personal most-hated plastic item: bottled water. It seems to me water fountains stopped being cared for right around the time bottled water became popular. We need more and *better-maintained* public drinking fountains and bottle filling stations, in all public buildings, in any institution that receives public funding (i.e. museums and universities), in parks, and out on the street as well.",

            "comment": "1) When possible, I try to choose the option which contains less plastic, especially disposable packaging.  That said, products are often over packaged and for some reason I've never quite understood, the \"value\" items often have MORE packaging.  For instance, I needed to purchase some travel mugs for a work conference the other day.  If I bought the mugs singly at most retailers, they were approximately $15-$20 each.  However, I could purchase the \"bulk\" pack at Costco, containing two mugs for $13.  I was very upset because the Costco deal meant a lot of unnecessary packaging, but at such a cost savings (about $100 difference in total for my purchase), I couldn't afford the better environmental choice.  \n\nI think people consider a variety of values in each purchase decision (consciously or not) and must balance a variety of conflicting interests, such as wasteful packaging, longevity, cost, impact on local economy, fair trade, health impacts, social impacts, etc.  In the absence of available or reliable information about all of their values, people usually default to price.\n\n2) Government and industry can work to internalize the cost of plastics, taking into consideration the environmental impact.  Perhaps disincentives on unnecessary plastic components?\nEvery part of the supply chain should carefully analyze their impacts and determine what packaging can be removed.\nIndividuals can vote with their dollars.",

Doesn't it defeat the purpose?).  We need more options for a greater range of recyclable materials.  i.e., government should invest in industries which are developing new markets for the recycled materials.  Also, an otherwise recyclable material can be made not recyclable by something ridiculous, like adding a bit of glue or a convenience spout.  That needs to stop.  The recycling symbol is currently unregulated and it is misleading to the consumer who may purchase a product feeling that it is the better choice because it is recyclable, but it gets diverted to the landfill at the recycling sorting centre anyway.",

It's very challenging to shop in a grocery store without purchasing a plastic-wrapped food item. Large urban centers may have stores with more options but everywhere else you are very limited by your options where you choose to shop. \n2. Governments could incentivize industries to minimize plastics in their packaging. Conventional grocery stores could do a better job at simulating a market or bulk food store.",

            "comment": "1) If it's not recyclable packaging I usually avoid buying the item and if it is over-packaged I also think twice and often pass on purchasing the item. I support places like the bulk barn that allow you to bring in your own re-usable containers. Whenever possible  I try to avoid buying items made of plastic and instead opt for glass, natural fibers, compostable materials, recyclable materials or plastics that I can re-use many times or even re-purpose. \n\n2) I think most consumers are on board with reducing plastics in our landfills and the environment in general. Governments and industry have the greatest roles to play in reducing plastics. I strongly believe governments need to legislate industry to completely stop producing single-use plastics and institute significant fines for offenders. As for all other durable and safe plastics that are produced, consumers should be able to return these items (at their end of life) and in the case of packaging, have the option of not having to take plastic packaging which would also be sent back to the company to re-use\/re-purpose by the store selling the product. Consumer's could be enticed to return plastics to companies by receiving a monetary incentive for each item returned (similar to when I was a kid and would return glass pop bottles for 5 or 10 cents apiece). \nInnovative and environmentally\/socially responsible companies should also receive incentives for coming up with product & packaging materials that completely break down (i.e. compost completely into safe components and not biodegrade) or again be responsible for taking back they're products and re-using all materials (even those materials that are not plastic). As an example, Germany mandates that many companies take back their products and re-use\/re-purpose all materials. \nIt is very upsetting to see plastic everywhere in the environment (even on a back country canoe trip only accessible by canoe) and know the threat it poses to wildlife and humans and the eye sore it creates in our environment.",

Working with our current waste management systems is key.  \nLastly: We must encourage more on-site recycling or re-manufacturing of plastics.  We, in Canada, can use our plastic waste to make new products instead of trying to ship it somewhere else.  This is a good opportunity for social enterprises.",

            "comment": "I understand that the terms of reference for this discussion are reducing plastic waste. I would like to ask a basic question, \"Is the issue quantity of plastic waste or how we handle it?\n\nI suspect the real issue is the later, not the former.\n\nTo set the stage, I would like to restate some basic concepts. Earth is essentially a closed system other than the arrival and departure of a few meteorites, space rockets and some radiation. Most of the earth's surface is covered with water and soil that was once 'waste'. Oil is a waste or valuable product depending on what we do with it. If plastic was food, we would have no plastic waste. All waste is eventually recycled or we would be buried in it since it would accumulate indefinitely. \n\nWaste is not a distinct product but is a definition of an intermediate product of existence and life. The wine we enjoy is the 'urine' of the yeast which consumes the sugar in the grapes. That is why wine can never have more than 14% alcohol since the yeast poisons itself above that concentration (a good lesson for the human species).\n  \nUltraviolet radiation is very effective in breaking up the long chain carbon molecules that form plastics. Since plastics are primarily carbon based molecules, they oxidize (burn) readily. However, probably due to their short existence, there are no widespread life forms that 'consume' plastics (although some are being developed naturally and in labs) so plastics cannot be recycled through 'normal' natural processes.   \n\nThus, we need to manage them better and not rely on nature to clean up after us.\n\nJim",

            "comment": "In my mind there are two big things that could be done to minimize plastic waste and both concern plastic films such as used in packaging, or as single use grocery bags and the like.\n1. Take steps to minimize their use, which can be driven by government regulation\n2. Substitute the kinds of plastics used to ones that biodegrade.\n\nPlastic films are notoriously difficult to collect and recycle, instead of relying on a system of better capture at the end of the useful life of the product (requiring virtually the entire nation to take part and do so effectively) better to prevent them being produced in the first place. Furthermore plastic films are typically not intended to survive forever, the packaging on products is clearly intended to be taken off and thrown away, and yet they are often made of plastics that resist degradation in the environment such as polyethylene. Instead of degrading into their chemical constituents these plastics are mechanically broken down into smaller and smaller chunks of plastic that then persist in the environment for ages. This is a glaring failure of design. If these were made of biodegradable plastics (they do exist, for example PLA) then should they enter the environment the impact is minimized.\n\nThe government could regulate plastic usage in this case, banning plastic bags unless made of biodegradable materials for example, and consumers could signal their preferences by buying more sustainably packaged goods. Industry has a large opportunity to be proactive and develop innovative packaging designs and new materials to meet the needs in Canada and in the rest of the world. Alternatively the government could impose a tax on plastic film packaging and use the money to fund research and retooling of industry, making Canada a hub for innovation in the move to a world free of plastic waste.\n\nWith Canada leading the way on this, and joining a larger coalition of countries including Europe, we can further drive changes in packaging around the world. If a manufacturer must package their material so as to minimize plastic waste for a large enough segment of their market then they hardly have much incentive to maintain another packaging line entirely for smaller markets that don't have such onerous requirements.",

Industries should be accountable for the waste they help create, and provide consumers options that are plastic free or made of only recyclable plastics. I also believe that this will only be achieved if the Government of Canada puts legislations in place.  \n\nFrance, the UK and a few other countries have or will introduced a ban on single use plastics such as plastic bags, straws, cutlery, plates, and more. I think it would be great if Canada would also introduce a ban on single use plastics, and innovate in the development of plastic free solutions. \n\nThere are already many great alternatives to plastic in place.  \nTo name a few\u2026 \n\nTo replace plastic straws = pasta straws, aluminum straws\nTo replace plastic cutlery = cutlery made of bamboo, flour, wood\nTo replace produce plastic bags = cloth mesh bags \nTo replace plastic plates\/bowls = flour or plant based plates and bowls\n\nI strongly believe Canada should join France, the UK and other countries and introduce a ban on single use plastics, to save our oceans, save our environment and our planet for future generations.",

            "comment": "1. I consider if it is a discretionary item that I do not need or can be replaced with a reusable or alternative option. Or if it is an essential item that cannot be replaced by a more ocean friendly alternative. For example, for clothing I try to avoid plastic where possible. But for skiing it is pretty hard not to select a plastic coat if you want to stay dry. So when plastic cannot be avoided, I try to select a reputable brand with a lifetime guarantee and bluesign or something to tell me they are using the best chemistry available so that i can minimize my impact to the environment over the lifespan of the product. Over 50% of fibres used in clothing are plastic. With new research indicating that 80% of microplastics in the pacific northwest oceans are from clothing such as fleece, there is a huge need for government and industry to work collaboratively to redesign or rethink plastic clothing in order to protect our oceans.\n\n2. \nGovernments can employ policy and programs to encourage business towards adopting circular economy business practices. Integrating design with business decisions under a circular economy framework will help business not only innovate, but innovate towards a shared vision of reducing waste and improving the health of the oceans. Suggested reading: \"Products that Last\" from Delft University.\n\nGovernment can adopt new compostable plastics regulations to avoid confusion and greenwashing. Currently many compostable plastics labeled as BPI or BNQ are either not accepted or not properly processed (screened out and sent to disposal) at local facilities. Since compostable plastics look the same as regular plastics, some residents put regular plastic in their green bins. As plastics contamination in industrial compost is one of the identified as on of the possible sources of marine plastics, the government could help reduce marine plastics by imposing stricter regulations around what can be marketed and sold as compostable and requiring certified compostable packaging producers to label their products in a specific way so they can easily be identified. Since biodegrable plastics can result in microplastics, the government could protect our oceans by not allowing companies to label products as biodegrable. \n\nThe government could work with and fund organisations such as the Ellen McArthur Foundation, Circle Economy and Canada's National Zero Waste Council to develop circular economy education for business to support their transition to the circular economy.\n\nThe Federal Government could help coordinate efforts to reduce marine plastics at all levels of government by creating and supporting committees in each province to help coordinate federal, provincial and local government actions to reduce marine litter. Currently efforts and research are not well connected.\n\nBusiness and industry develop single-use item reduction plans and adopt circular economy business and design practices.",

I go out of my way to avoid plastic, but often find myself in a bind where the only solution is yet another item wrapped in or made from plastic. \n2. Individuals can make a change by making a conscious choice to buy items that are not wrapped in plastic -- stop buying precut fruit and vegetables, stop putting loose produce into plastic bags, think ahead and bring a reusable bag with you to avoid needing a plastic bag, bring a reusable mug for coffee and a reusable water bottle rather than buying a plastic bottle or getting a disposable cup. Look for dairy products packaged in glass that can be returned, sanitized and reused by the manufacturer. Buy in bulk - Bulk Barn is making it so easy to bring your own containers! Choose items that are not wrapped in plastic.  \n\nGovernment, and industry, can contribute to reducing plastic waste by making it easier to invest in reusable packaging. If it's easier to release products packaged in glass, that can be returned, sanitized, and reused, we will have less need for plastic packaging. I believe Germany has a particular kind of recycling bin for reusable glass jars, so that individuals can return these jars to manufacturers so that the container can be reused. We shouldn't improve plastic products and packaging, we should reduce it's availability and stop the stranglehold that it has on us as consumers. Don't make it better - make it easier to choose non-plastic options.",

Most pop is bottled in plastic instead of glass now and there are a number of advantages.  It weighs less, reducing transport cost (fuel) and it also has less potential to break and cut some one.  It is also less intensive to make a few grams of plastic that 100's of grams of glass...\n2.  Governments can promote better end uses of plastics in recycling...Like a plastics to fuels company to take all mixed plastic and convert it to a valuable product like diesel.  This will displace crude oil production and remove plastic from landfills.  Also reduce the need to sort plastic at a recycle facility.  Individuals can place waste in an appropriate bucket and understand the needs of the recycle facility in their jurisdiction in order to have a positive impact.",

When it comes to food, I buy all my meat from a ranch that vacuum seals their meats in plastic so I can put it in my freezer for long periods of time without it spoiling. It also means that I can wash the bags and toss them in the recycling bin unlike the styrofoam at the grocery store. With many things I prefer to buy in plastic since it is recyclable. I reduce my plastic use where I feel it is not adding value, such as by bringing reusable bags to stores. \n\n2. I think education is a big one, I think there are lots of people still throwing recyclable items into garbage bins instead of into recycling bins. In Alberta (and I think most provinces) we can take bottles (plastic or glass, cans, etc.) to the bottle depot for a refund of the deposit paid, could something like this be introduced for other forms of plastic? Maybe by weight or something, if people get money back for their plastic they will be incentivized to make sure it enters the recycling stream.",

            "comment": "When I purchase items made of plastic, I look for recyclable symbols and for how the packaging will make my life safer and easier. For example, choosing plastic containers instead of glass to reduce the risk from breakage. Plastic also weighs much less than glass, and in turn reduces the amount of fuel used and greenhouse gases produced during transportation. I believe that we should move the focus from eliminating plastics to adjusting what is done with them post-use. If plastics are made of a single type of plastic, they are able to be recycled. Many multi-layer film packaging cannot be recycled due to the different types of material it is made of. I think that industries should focus on creating packaging made with a single type of plastic, and ensure that the recycling symbol is clearly visible. Once I started checking labels on packaging, I reduced my family's weekly garbage by a whole bag.",

            "comment": "1. In general, I try to avoid buying things made with plastic or packaged in plastic, but at times it can be almost impossible. Unfortunately, most manufacturers do not provide consumers with a non-plastic option. Or, if a manufacturer has selected a non-plastic option, it is sometimes priced higher than the non-plastic option. And while I would pay more for a non-plastic item, it does depend on the price as to how much more I would spend. \n\n2. I think the first step is for governments to enact laws that restrict the use of plastic in many industries. This would stop plastic from getting into the world from the start (and we wouldn't have to worry about what to do with it later). These laws, of course, would need to take emergency and medical-related issues into account by limiting the use of plastic to items that simply cannot effectively be made of another substance.\n\nI also think that industries should voluntarily stop using plastic where they can, even if it is the cheaper option. For example, there is almost no good use for a disposable plastic straw that cannot be satisfied with a non-plastic straw. Manufacturers of plastic straws really need to evaluate if the continued manufacturing of these straws is beneficial to the world, in general, not just to their bottom line. Of course, cigarette manufacturers still exist, so there's definitely a good chance most manufacturers will not take into account their impact on the world as a whole -- which is where laws come into play.\n\nIndividuals, I believe, are between a rock and a hard place. While individuals can opt not to purchase items made of plastic or packaged in plastic, they only have so many options to choose from. Plus, economic aspects may further limit what some individuals are able to afford. Individuals should be responsible to recycle as much plastic as possible, but again, this is dependent upon where they live and what the local government has set up in terms of waste management. In most situations, individuals do not have a choice as to what plastic items are and are not recycled where they live. And if the item is not recycled where they live, they really do not have any other option than to place it in the garbage. \n\nAgain, this is where the government can come in. If recycling were a provincial or nationally managed effort, there would be consistency between what can and cannot be recycled around the country. Individuals would be less confused and would be able to make better choices as consumers. Plus, if recycling was managed at the provincial or national level, smaller communities who do not have the resources or quantities to get good deals would be able to participate in more effective recycling programs.\n\nFinally, I think it is the government's and industry's responsibility to fund, encourage and manage research that looks into the creation of products that can replace plastic. While I would love to see better methods of recycling introduced as well, improving recycling methods is simply a bandaid on a much larger problem of plastics being produced in the first place. Recycling should be a last resort for plastics, the 'first' resort should be not to make them at all.",

Individuals can put pressure on governments and industries, but ultimately they are locked into our society's fashion of consumerism and can only altar their actions as much as their environment currently allows. Governments need to enact legislation, such as a law that by 2030 all companies must make their packaging either biodegradable or recylcable and reusable when biodegradable materials are not an option. They must force companies to change their habits and have Life-Cycle assessments in place in order to account for all of the waste from their products and how it can be dealt with in a sustainable manner. Companies need to look at where they can cut costs by reducing packaging and changing it to biodegradable materials. They might even be able to come up with products that the packaging can be used as rather than waste. They should also be buying recycled materials to create new packaging as often as possible and ensure that their product remains recyclable.",

            "comment": "I consider packaging these days when making purchases.  ie While I like buying organic produce, in my local grocery store lately the organic broccoli and cauliflower comes wrapped in plastic - but not the non-organic variety.  So I have stopped buying as much organic as I'd like to.  I found nylon mesh produce bags online that I use - those could be available for sale in grocery stores just like you can find reusable grocery bags near the checkout.\nI also look for items that are not made of plastic, if there is an alternative, and I consider walking away from the item if it's plastic and not essential.\nAdmittedly, plastics have made our lives easier in many ways since they were introduced in the 1950s.  Unfortunately, virtually every plastic item ever produced is still on the planet in some non-natural form or other.  I believe the harm single-use plastics are responsible for (in the oceans, landfills and as the \u201cbreak down\u201d into small plastic particles) far outweighs their utility.    I would strongly support Canada phasing in a ban on single use plastics \u2013 straws, bags, stir sticks, cutlery \u2013 even water bottles.  There are alternatives.  The Mariposa Folk Festival has, for a number of years, only allowed food venders into the park for the festival if 100% of their packaging is compostable \u2013 including cutlery.  They ask ticket-holders to bring their own water bottle and the festival provides water stations where they can be filled.  Personally, I think taxing items that are made of plastic more than those made of natural materials would help discourage all those plastic kids toys that will be on the planet long after we\u2019re all gone, as well as other plastic items.  What happened to toasters made of metal?  And glass and metal blenders etc?  We might pay a little more for them, but they last, and will break down into something the planet can re-absorb.  An education campaign would probably help to show people how their purchase choices affect the planet.\nI\u2019m sure there are many items out there that we benefit from in their plastic form, and if those are the plastics produced, and there was a way to return them to the manufacturer to be broken down and reused later, the earth would be a healthier place.  But our current recycling system is broken \u2013 if it ever was whole.  We need a new approach that takes the full product and package lifecycle into account.",

Are these important; yes, mainly because of their random disposal by their users. Are they significant; no mainly because they a re such a tiny portion of the total plastic creation\/consumption on the planet. \n\nI would propose that 100 new cars consume\/produce more plastic (by weight) than all the plastic straws used in Canada in one year. The question is not how we use plastics but how we dispose of them (i.e. what we do to break them down into molecules that are easily assimilated by nature).\n\nThe portion of oil and coal derivatives used to produce plastics which are then dispersed over the planet is probably equivalent to the amount of oil used to power the world's private vehicle fleet. And worse, these fuels are converted into recyclable molecules when used whereas those hydrocarbons converted to plastics take many, many centuries to be similarly converted into recyclable molecules.\n\nI would suggest we are focusing on the wrong problem, thus ensuring we will not solve the problem. Yes plastic bags and straws are highly visible but quantitatively insignificant. \n\nJim Knock",

            "comment": "1) When purchasing objects made of plastic, I ask myself a number of questions: a) Is there an alternative that uses less plastic? b) Is it possible to reuse the plastic? c) Can I buy it second hand so that I am saving something from the landfill, rather than buying a new product? d) Do I really need the thing in the first place?\n\n2) Many objects that are currently made of plastic were once made of material that was either biodegradable (usually a cellulose based material like wood, paper or cotton), or they were made out of an easy to recycle material, mostly metals.  For example, Q-tip stems were made of bamboo, chocolate bare wrappers were made of either cardboard (Smarties boxes still are made of cardboard) or tough paper, housing for small appliances or power tools were made of aluminum, lollipop stems were made of tightly rolled rods of paper, chip bags were made of paper.  Many of these past decisions could be reversed, either by companies who want to market to environmentally concerned purchasers, or by government regulations or incentives.  If the paper products were made of at least some recycled fiber, that would be even better.",

            "comment": "Something new just popped up on KickStarter. this is especially good for those of us who do not like using single use straws.\n\nFull disclosure here: I have no business or personal interest in this venture. I did, however, sign up to receive six of the items.\n\nA  couple weeks ago, a new startup was released on KickStarter called The Last Straw. This is a reusable straw that folds down to the size of a key. It is made of stainless steel and surgical\/food grade tubing. It comes with a cleaning squeegee and a carrying case so you can have a straw wherever you need one without resorting to throw-away plastics. This is one small step to a plastic-free future.\n\nFor those of us that must eat on the run and use plastic throwaway utensils (usually unrecyclable black plastic) why not purchase a transportable, reusable utensil set available from just about any store where you can purchase camping equipment.\n\nWhatever happened to paper straws, anyway?",

Supermarkets or any other vendor have no plastic bags to sell or to wrap. Shopping bags have been encouraged and used ultimately.  After years of creating an awareness of the dangers, the people were taking too long to internalize this so the government legalised the ban.\n\nIncluding smoking in public the fine is enormous and designated areas built for smokers. For climate change this was a great achievement to meet sustainable goals.\n\nI would suggest a research and study to on how Canada would react to such a radical move",

In both Toronto and Kingston (the cities of which I have knowledge) composting something when out in public is nearly impossible, regardless of whether its on the street, in a park, on campus, or in a business. As a start to curbing plastic waste, plastic bag bans and plastic cutlery\/straws\/cups bans are necessary, and replaced with biodegradable materials. There should be subsidies and support for business who want to increase their bulk\/alternative packaging or zero-waste stores to open!",

            "comment": "There are some provincial projects happening in northern Ontario, apparently, building greenhouses to sell low-cost vegetables. I know that the \"little guys\" in farming and fisheries have lost a lot from big corporate competition\/takeover. In the summer we see popular farmers markets all over Ontario, and usually the items are packed loosely. The organic at-your-door boxes are popular but often expensive. I would like to see the federal government create a program to expand the \"little guys\" businesses  including indigenous up-starts into year round farming keeping them going. Producing produce in greenhouses sold loose all year round, and also fish farming.Use local talent for once.The benefits of establishing these programs now are to many, allowing for the shift they want) and shows good foresight (and who wants to be responsible for eating plastic fish in the smog after a hurricane while thinking about a glaciation?) and would decrease carbon foot print and plastic use. I would buy year-round loose local salad and farmed fish. Maybe what is needed is more eco availability to normalize the plastic take-over. I would start 5 non-profit eco companies but I have a hard enough time paying the interest on my student loan. fyi Low-cost is no longer a bad word (ultra low-cost flights). There is a lot of talk about \"economic prosperity\" but if this can only really be for 1\/2 or so of the population now with the other half keep the first half prosperous. And if you haven't entered a dollar store lately, its more like the four dollar store. Let's be honest about moving towards zero or not.",

History has shown that government prohibition has not ever been very successful when the people consuming\/using the banned product do not wish to stop using it for whatever reason (drugs, racism, sugar consumption, alcohol, single use commuting, foodstuff, etc. \n\nWhy do we think it will be different this time?\n\nUnless we re-balance the 'forces' that currently maintain society's 'standard practices', no government will move to ban any product in popular use knowing that it will merely prove how ineffectual that would be. Would a 'war on plastics' be any more effective than the 'war on drugs' was?",

            "comment": "Many individuals have suggested that manufacturers be required to accept and manage their Packaging waste. In my mind, this raises some interesting questions:\n\n1 Most sellers do not do their own packaging (including grocery stores); so who should be responsible for recycling the waste associated with the wastes produced when the consumer disposes of all the plastics associated with the sale?\n\n2 Since 90% of our consumer purchases are manufactured in many countries mostly outside Canada, so should the consumer need to pay (directly or indirectly) to ship the associated wastes back to the country where they are produced? How about if they are packaged inside Canada? How about if they are packaged in another part of Canada?\n\n3 Since Canada has very efficient plastic waste recycling operations in most urban centers but virtually none outside cities due to distances and economies of scale, do rural shoppers need to make special trips to cities to return their waste plastic.\n\n4 Anyone with a fireplace knows that small quantities of waste plastic are easily burnt without excess pollution. Is there any reason why burning candles or furnace oil are acceptable but not burning equivalent amounts of plastic even though both are hydrocarbons and give off the same amount of pollution.\n\n5 From the global perspective, should we send our waste plastics outside the country if it provides valuable employment to low income, third world workers (using Canadian technology and capital)?\n\n6 If plastics provide the least cost option to many real world problems (automobiles continue to up the amount of plastics in vehicle construction (now approaching 25% by weight) and go back to less efficient options? (i.e. through loss of durability and increased vehicle weight, the consumption of hydrocarbons per average vehicle mile would increase, thus adding to net greenhouse gas production and increased global warming).\n\nI believe the real issue is what happens after the use\/consumption of plastics is complete (i.e. when their economic value switches from positive to negative, from a commodity to a waste), not the creation and use of plastics. We could easily draft legislation that would ban plastics within Canada and we would almost instantly convert Canada into a third world economy should that ban be successfully enforced.\n\nOf course there is much room for reducing our 'waste plastic obesity'. Doing so meaningfully should be our focus, not a superficial attack on a insignificant example (i.e. plastic straws). \n\nWe replaced glass, natural fabrics, metals, etc with plastics and put a 'bounty' on glass, metals. The result was these waste streams mostly disappeared. Now we talk about replacing plastic with glass, natural fabrics, metals, etc. because of the growth in the plastic waste streams.\n\nPlastics have many valuable characteristics, thus their huge growth in new applications over the past 80 years. The one characteristic that is problematic is that Nature has yet to learn how to biodegrade them like it has the products plastics have replaced, In the long term, this will be resolved, probably with human help. In the short term we need to assist Nature by collecting (or eliminating some low utility) plastic wastes and reducing them to reusable molecules that nature will then absorb and recycle.\n\nTelling the tide what to do has never proven to be very successful.",

This would eliminate 2 problems, using ashphalt which needs constant up keep and plastics that are filling the oceans.  For a country that can afford to use better technology and workers would not have ot loss their jobs as they can be trained in using the materials recycled and plastics are all over the ocean so there needs to be an ocean program that cleans the plastics and cleaning the waters and this creates jobs.  the infrastructure doesn't have to change it is the people who are putting this old archaic style of structure, it is time for a change and the technology is there to make it happen, let's use the technology.  There are so many advancements we need our government to set the structure in place so that the money needed to support a better cleaner planet will happen.  thank you",

            "comment": "I make well informed and conscious purchasing decisions. I dislike using and buying products covered in plastics. I try to avoid single use plastics as much as i can, but it is too challenging, as plastics are everywhere!!! I understand there is a need for plastics, but there should be no place in society for single use or short use plastics. We are an innovative society, and to solve our use of plastics requires some creativity, and new design thinking with sustainability considerations at the forefront. Companies that create or use single use plastics should be held accountable. They need to rethink their business models and how to reduce - drastically reduce - our consumption of single use or short use plastics.\n\nGovernments should ban single use plastics (straws, bags, packaging, etc.). full stop. Enterprises won't change their practices, or fast enough, unless government intervenes on this critical issue.",

            "comment": "Hello, \n\nAs a citizen of this country I am concerned about the use of plastic and the waste that it produces in this country and I\u2019d like to submit a few ideas that I think we should adopt in order to help curb the use of plastic in our society and prevent the negative impacts that come with it. \n\n\u2022Implement a tax on all manufactures that produce plastic which is non biodegradable and cannot be recycled easily. This tax could be anywhere from 5 cents a ton to 1 dollar or more of plastic that is produced. Having a tax on plastic manufactures will encourage them to produce less plastic waste and\/or invest money into research and development of plastics that would not incur this tax such as biodegradable plastics or plant based plastics known as bio-plastics. \n\nMonies from this tax could be put into a fund controlled by the government to research strategies and ideas that can reduce plastic waste in Canada and support programs across the country that are implementing plastic reduction programs, diversion programs of plastic into landfills and waterways and funding to companies or individuals who are researching non petroleum based plastics such as bio-plastics. \n\n\u2022Canada, along with other G7 nations can create a global fund to help pay for better waste management practices and infrastructure. A coordinated national strategy to combat plastics pollution, backed up by law should be implemented across the country. \n\n\u2022Create a nationwide supply chain to intercept ocean-bound plastic trash and turn it into everything from packaging and furniture to bicycle parts. Companies can seek federal investment to help run this program but would be independent. Implementation of a ban on black plastic food containers should also be implemented. Black plastic food containers and single use items are not recycled in municipalities due to recycling machines not being able to detect the color black due to conveyor belts being black. \n\n\n\u2022Implement a phased in ban of all single use petroleum based plastic items. These items include plastics bags, food trays, non recyclable coffee cups, Styrofoam etc. Basically a ban on any single use plastic that is non recyclable or non biodegradable.  The public much be made aware of a ban before it is implemented in order to provide public discussion about the issue and prepare people and companies a chance to seek alternatives to petroleum based plastics. For example Phasing in a ban will allow time for stores to stop buying plastic bags from manufactures and seek an alternative to offer customers, a phased in ban will allow customers to seek alternatives such as reusable bags which are also sold in stores. \n\nA phased in ban will allow manufactures time to research, design and manufacture non petroleum based plastics such as bio-plastic bags which are biodegradable and can replace the single use bags we consume now. While this ban is being implemented a tax should be levied on all single use plastic items such as plastic bags or coffee cups to encourage citizens and businesses to seek alternatives such as reusable bags or a travel mug to put their coffee in instead of a single use one. The monies generated from these taxes can be reinvested into programs that reduce plastic waste and invested into research and development of recyclable, biodegradable based plastics. Again the tax on single use items could be anywhere from 5 cents per item to 1 dollar or more but the tax must be enough to actually encourage people to avoid single use plastic items and therefore a tax of 1 dollar per single use item or more seems preferable. \n\n\u2022The Canadian government along with private industry can remove plastic waste found in the oceans, and other bodies of water and reuse that plastic and make it into usable items. This idea is to clean up bodies of water from the plastic that already exists within them and create strategies to prevent plastic from entering bodies of water in the first place. \n\n\u2022Implement a program similar to British Columbia\u2019s multi material B.C. whereby the responsibilities of recycling materials from households and businesses are taken away from municipalities who are responsible for paying for recycling and pass that responsibility onto companies and industries that create the waste in the first place. Doing this will force them to implement more efficient ways of recycling and reducing waste to help lower the cost they are paying for recycling in the first place. Municipalities and therefore citizen tax payers should not have to pay the cost of plastic waste that manufactures and businesses create. \n\n\u2022Canada along with the private industry should jointly invest into research, design, development and implementation of alternatives to petroleum based plastics. These alternatives would include biodegradable plastics, plant based plastics known as bio-plastics, enzymes that eat plastic waste and plastics that can infinitely be reused over and over again and can be recovered by manufactures for reuse from consumers creating a constant circle and thus never having the plastic enter a landfill or waterway. \n\n\n\u2022\thttps:\/\/www.theweathernetwork.com\/news\/articles\/procter-and-gamble-pushing-to-recycle-ocean-plastic-fairy-liquid-soap\/96269\/\n\n\u2022\thttps:\/\/www.theweathernetwork.com\/news\/articles\/plants-could-help-solve-the-worlds-plastic-problem\/96424\/\n\n\u2022\thttps:\/\/ca.news.yahoo.com\/plastic-eating-protein-created-british-202352197.html\n\n\n\u2022\thttps:\/\/www.mnn.com\/green-tech\/research-innovations\/stories\/infinitely-recyclable-polymer-could-be-future-plastics",

A durable plastic basket lined with wax paper should be good enough. The restaurants can save money on paper products. And they can easily buy a dishwasher to clean the plastic baskets. There should be regulations that fast food restaurants offer a recycling option and slimmer packaging option. In my opinion commercial restaurants should try to produce less trash and they should pay if they exceed a trash limit from mismanagement of waste ie. no recycling in store or bins are poorly designed \n\nAlso, all public spaces and even private\/public spaces should have recycling bin available not just trash.\n\nInstead of taxing people out of Canada there should be better management",

If I can avoid packaging I will do my best but often this is not possible - especially when purchasing food, so when shopping I try and consider packaging I know is recyclable, but it's those resealable plastic laminate pouches I keep seeing more and more of - for kids snacks, frozen berries, crackers. Would love to see those go away.\n2. Something needs to be done to restrict what packaging can be used. A criteria on the manufacturers side needs to be set to prevent these non-recyclable packages from being used. They claim everything is recyclable but how can they say that when packaging is distributed nation-wide - they have no idea how things are managed, sorted, recycled in small towns or anywhere for that matter. Very frustrating. More opportunities need to be created to encourage responsible shopping practices - like Bulk Barn encouraging bringing your own containers; or more take back opportunities for bottles, jars, jugs, etc.  I can't believe we can't solve the coffee cup issue. What if compostable cups were actually compostable? And we could just put them in our backyard composters or green bins.",

They are an important contributor to the lower carbon economy through energy efficiency and green energy production. We need to judge plastic products on their life cycle impacts not just their recyclability. \n\nThe production and consumption of plastics continues to grow in Canada because consumers want the safety, health, and convenience benefits plastics offers. Brand owners and retailers need the sustainability benefits it delivers. Plastics innovations are essential to increasing living standards via new products that design out waste, improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions while increasing reuse, recycling and recovery. Restricting or banning the use of plastics will increase the cost to our environment because alternative materials have a significantly bigger negative impact over their lifecycle.\n\nCanada should encourage policies that incentivize research innovation that will allow the market to deliver solutions.",

            "comment": "Plastic packaging is almost always the most efficient packaging material when a comparison is made across impacts to water, land, air, and energy use. Plastic packaging is essential to the preservation of food and sterility of medical devices. The challenge we as a society are facing are the issues of single use products. We live in a culture where ease of use and convenience are highly valued. Whether we are recycling a plastic cup or a paper cup, we as consumers still too often choose to use the single use cup rather than bringing a reusable cup with us. Creating improved recycling and recovery options for these single use products and highly valued plastic packaging while continuing to design for recyclability and reuse are both critical to reducing our overall consumption and improving the reuse of the plastic resources we already have. Funding innovation in this area is an opportunity for Canada to lead the world in responsible resource use.",

The best system I have seen are the tall blue plastic recycling bins in parks. These are easy to see and recognize what goes in, but on the street the bins are grey and the deposit slots small and the pictures identifying  what to do are small. I have looked into some garbage bins and recycling and its like everything and the kitchen sink is in there. If this is a problem where recycling is diverted to waste then maybe you should re-think why its not easy enough for people to throw their garbage where it belongs. There isn't a way to extend plastic life once its in the landfill. And at the rate Canada produces garbage there wont be enough landfill space to sustain it all. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.canadiangeographic.ca\/article\/canadas-dirty-secret\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/magazine\/2018\/06\/plastic-planet-waste-pollution-trash-crisis\/",

Our opinions matter only if to find some exotic solution that the professionals may have overlooked (a very low probability).\n\nTo really understand the scope and dimensions of the problem, the government need only study what is placed in the plastic waste disposal\/recycling system and what happens to it throughout the process from initial purchase to final disposition. These longitudinal studies will provide all the information needed to resolve the quantity and nature of the problem.\n\nI think I can safely say it will require a major shift in consumer awareness and acceptance for any solution to be implemented. That is the challenge, not what environmentally committed plastic consumers say and do.",

            "comment": "An interesting article on how to make plastic out of air pollution. \n\nThis creates a sustainable way to acquire the raw materials needed to produce plastic which can then be recycled and it also helps reduce air pollution and thus can make people healthier, reduce health care costs and reduce global warming. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.theweathernetwork.com\/news\/articles\/making-plastic-out-of-the-air-pollution-we-breathe-carbon-climate-change-global-warming-ocean-ethylene\/102318\/\n\n\"We use fossils to make oil, trees to make rubber, and soon could be using air to make plastic.\n\nHumans are creating too much plastic and too much carbon. It is predicted that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans and current concentration levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are 410 parts per million (ppm) - for the past 800,000 years carbon dioxide levels fluctuated but never exceeded 300 ppm, until the Industrial Revolution.\n\nMany companies, such as IKEA, are becoming more environmentally-friendly by reducing their carbon emissions and plastic use, while scientists are developing technologies to capture carbon from the air and use it to make plastic for the things we need and rely on, such as packaging, electronics, medical equipment, and so on.\n\nNewlight Technologies is a company that captures the carbon from the air, processes it in a reactor where a microorganism biocatalyst is applied to rearrange the carbon molecules into a chain of polymers, which creates a patented plastic called AirCarbon. It is then melted down into pellets that are shaped into items, such as the chair below.\n\nIn 2016 Newlight signed a 10 billion pound AirCarbon production deal with IKEA, who gained exclusive rights in the home furnishings industry to AirCarbon technology, meaning we can fight air pollution and furnish our homes at the same time. Both Dell and The Body Shop partnered with Newlight in 2014 and 2015, respectively, to make packaging using AirCarbon technology.\n\nPlastics are typically made from crude oil, a type of fossil fuel, that produces carbon dioxide in the manufacturing process. Dr. Cao-Thang Dinh and other scientists from the University of Toronto have recently developed a way to use the sun as a source of energy to convert carbon dioxide into ethylene, a compound needed to make plastic.\n\nDinh explains that the alarming rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should make us think of new ways to be more sustainable, which is why renewable energy was an important part of this technology. \u201cWe store three tonnes of carbon dioxide in one tonne of ethylene that we produce\u201d says Dinh, explaining the technology\u2019s ability to remove carbon from the air.\n\nDinh is member of the CERT team that is competing in the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE competition, where teams from around the world compete for a $20 million dollar prize for developing innovative technologies that convert carbon dioxide into valuable products. CERT will be competing alongside Newlight Technologies as two of the remaining five competitors in the final stages of the competition, which ends March 2020.\n\nOther companies are joining the sustainability trend by using plastic to offer customers innovative items \u2013 Adidas has sold 1 million shoes made out of ocean plastic, Method sold soap in the world\u2019s first bottles made of ocean plastic and recycled plastic, and E6PR recently released biodegradable six-pack rings to make beer packaging safer for ocean animals.\n\nThe variety of designs, technologies, and applications for plastic sustainability demonstrates the potential for finding a solution to our pollution problem, particularly in light of entire cities and countries banning straws to do their part to save the environment from the dangers of plastic.\"",

            "comment": "Canada and the entire world has a big problem when it comes to waste, more specifically plastic waste. Something needs to be done with the government on a national scale for a noticeable impact to be made. Here are some valid and hopefully workable ideas that I found and came up with while researching. \n\n1. All single use plastics must be banned. This includes single use grocery bags, straws, plastic water bottles, cutlery and cups, among others. This needs to be done by the federal government as push-back will be received from other industries that help to produce these products, including the petroleum industry. Although, this may be hard single use plastics are not a necessary part of our lives and needs to be done as the first step on our journey to becoming a healthier, more environmentally friendly, and plastic free planet. This has been seen in many countries around the world and even in some cities in Canada. Montreal kicked off 2018 by banning single-use plastic bags. Merchants will have until June 5 and after that individuals and corporations will face up to $2,000 fines. The city of Montreal realized it was using 2 billion plastic bags a year and only 14% of those were being recycled. Furthermore, Victoria is also proposing a similar ban that will start on July 1 and will not allow businesses to provide plastic bags, and instead paper bags at a cost of 15 cents. These same bans and legislation should be created all over Canada. The federal government needs to ban single-use plastic bags at minimum and using these two cities as models it shouldn't be to difficult. \n\n2. Buying plastic free or package less products needs to be more accessible. Almost everything now a days including fresh products comes in plastic, when you buy mixed greens it comes in a plastic tub. Industries, companies and grocery stores are not making it easy for us consumers to purchase things without plastic packaging. One idea would be to make it mandatory for all grocery stores to have a package free isle. This may include refillable detergents and soaps, bulk foods, package free fruits and vegetables. If this is included in all community grocery stores, shopping package free will be much easier, potentially cheaper, and a lot more accessible for all. Reducing packaging is being seen by many smaller movements but hasn\u2019t been completely tackled by cities or countries yet. However, in Singapore companies have been taking steps to reduce packaging under an effort called the \u201cSingapore Packaging Agreement\u201d. More than 200 companies have signed the SPA and since 2007 the signatories have cumulatively reduced close to 39,000 tonnes of packaging waste, with cumulative savings of about $93 million in the material costs of locally consumed products. There is a ways to come but it can be done!\n\n3. I think there should be tax incentives, so people are wanting to avoid buying plastics. This may include increased HST on plastic items, or items with plastic packaging. There can also be the opposite effect, as Ontario lessens HST on the cost to repair old items. This hopefully would result in less items going to landfill, and changing the way we consume. Less tax or no tax could also be applied to bulk items or other things that don\u2019t involve any packaging, and more specifically plastic packaging. All this, would promote reusing and enable people to by plastic free items for less. \n\n4. Another thing to propose would be the creation of a deposit on all beverage containers and cans, not just alcoholic beverage containers. This would promote recycling and reduce the amount of garbage significantly. An example of this is seen right next door to us in Quebec. They have a recycling program where they offer 5 cents for almost all cans and beverage containers if brought to the recycling center. This promotes proper recycling and is not a way to ban plastic but instead lessen the overall effect!",

Many companies that have stopped using plastic have more expensive products since they are committed to quality, eco friendly materials, etc. The government could encourage a shift in consumer culture by creating an incentive to shop sustainably because people LOVE to buy things.",

Companies like Green Toys use 100% recycled plastic (like the durable high density poly plastics (HDPE)) in their toys, and they are very durable.  \n\nWhen purchasing items, I think \"do we really need so many options\" Example milk is available in multiple carton sizes.

I also consider whether I can recycle the plastic packaging afterwards, since several kinds of plastic packaging cannot be recycled in my city. To avoid having to throw out non-recyclable plastic, I have begun to buy more fresh fruit and vegetables, which I can place into my own reusable produce bags. I find it very frustrating that a number of the products I would like to buy sometimes are over-packaged or come in packaging that cannot be recycled.\n\n2. Our plastics problem is everyone's responsibility, so everyone needs to be involved in addressing this issue. I think this public consultation is a good start and that there needs to be more conversations about what should be done about this problem.\n\na) Governments can introduce bans or taxes on non-essential single-use plastics, such as Styrofoam take-out containers and plastic grocery bags. There are governments who have already done this, so we can look at which initiatives have been successful and learn from what has not worked well. Governments can also invest money into research on more sustainable alternatives to plastics.\n\nb) Industries should make environmental stewardship a priority and reduce the unnecessary use of plastics in their products. They should also work on ways to make their products longer-lasting and work with governments to ensure that their products (and the packing they come in) are fully recyclable so that it is easier for consumers to make more environmentally-responsible choices.\n\nc) Citizens can do their part by educating themselves about our plastics problem and about their municipal recycling programs. They can also avoid cheap, throwaway plastic items (such as single-use plastic water bottles and disposable plates and cutlery), bring reusable bags to grocery stores, take part in cleaning litter along shorelines and in their neighbourhoods, and talk with their friends and neighbours about our growing plastics problem.",

            "comment": "1) The main factor that I consider when purchasing products containing plastics is their longevity and eventual disposal destination. I make a point to only buy plastic based products that are durable enough to last for years without replacing. I also consider how these products can be disposed of when I have no further use of them, ideally I hope for them to be upcycled\/reused by someone else who can find a new use for them. Otherwise I try to choose plastics that are more readily recycled.\n\n2) I belief that individuals and governments can work together to influence industries to improve their practices when it comes to plastic products. \nI think that our governments should regulate industries producing plastics in the following ways:\n-Minimum warranty periods of at least 5 years for items such as cell phones and computers to motivate industry to produce higher quality, durable goods\n-Standardized packaging guidelines aimed at conforming with technology currently used by our recycling plants\n-Industries producing single use plastics should share in the cost of the recycling programs required to process their products. This will act as motivation to move away from the production of single use plastics\n\nGovernments can regulate service industries (e.g. restaurants, grocery stores)\n-Outright bans of common pollutants such as take out containers, disposable coffee cups, plastic cutlery, etc \n-Imposition of mandatory charges for the aforementioned single use plastics\n-Implementation of tax breaks on eco-friendly replacements for the aforementioned single use plastics\n\nIndividuals can make a difference by:\n-consciously choosing to avoid single use plastics and making these choices known to the stores\/services they visit.  \n-Taking the time to familiarize themselves with what products can be recycled and which cannot, as well as whether products are accepted by blue box programs or whether they need to be brought into a depot",

            "comment": "One of the big things we can do to reduce the amount of plastic waste is to reduce the amount of packaging that comes from the manufacturers. Products are over packaged, sometimes at 2 to 3 times the size of the item being purchased. Think of the packaging on batteries for example - the package is so much bigger than the actual batteries themselves. We should encourage manufacturers to reduce packaging, or use more sustainable packaging. Perhaps we need to shift the burden away from consumers and place a more heavy onus on the manufacturers.",

In the event that it is unavoidable, I make sure it is at least a recyclable plastic. \n2. The government needs to hold companies accountable for the waste that they produce, especially fast food companies. So much of the plastic waste is single use plastics from the fast food industry. Instead of putting that cost onto the environment, make the companies making the waste pay the cost. \nAdditionally, make all municipalities recycle all types of plastic. For example, in Ottawa we cannot recycle plastic bags yet everyone buys milk in plastic bags. If it is not available to be recycled in that area, it should not be allowed to be sold.",

This has often dissuaded me from purchasing.\nI feel governments should begin to work in partnership with industries (specifically manufacturers) to delve into research initiatives regarding different types of biodegradable packing alternatives that can be used to replace and at least reduce non-biodegradable plastic packaging. Understanding that switching to these types of alternative packaging will most likely be quite costly for manufactures to switch to, there needs to be government subsidies in place to assist them in these efforts.\nThere needs to be more education from governments aimed at consumers educating them on the damming effects plastic waste has especially on our lakes\/ocean life.",

You then filled a kettle, boiled the water and OMG had to pick up the kettle and pour it into the cup. Instead of dozens of little plastic cups to put in the garbage, or recycle where possible, there was one glass bottle to recycle. Apparently Camp coffee is still made but not readily available. Must supposed plastic convenience is just a way of getting more money from the consumer for the unnecessary use of what will be scarce resources and then the consumer has the inconvenience of dealing with the leftovers.\nThere has to be pressure on the producers of supposed \"value-added\" products by people and government at all levels to change this stupidity.",

            "comment": "I consider the cost, can I reuse the container, my city has a recycling program so can it be recycled, was it made responsibly. \nWhat can be done about the concerns, what type of plastic is ending up in the wrong locations and why.  People themselves need to take responsibility they should always use the appropriate container to dispose of the plastic (recycling).  People should never just throw any garbage on the ground or in the water and think someone else will take care of it.  I do not think banning a product is going to help however providing a choice so that people made educated decisions would be better. Example water bottles they do provide convenience but you can use a reusable one or drink from a fountain\/tap water with cup that can be washed.  If you do like straws then don't use them but they also make reusable ones.  When it comes to packages such as milk plastic is involved usually unless you get a carton but then they can also be recycled just like the plastic option however plastic is usually cheaper to the consumer and manufacturer.  Governments do not need to tell the people what to do this is a free country and there are responsible choices to be made.  As far as industries they need to ensure there products are being constructed properly with little impact to the environment and is they can be made to be reused then they should be.  However if the industry find items such as microbeads that cause harm to the marine life and food chain then they should themselves say no I will not participate.  The companies that are using the microbeads need to also stand up and take measures to correct the damage they have done.",

Next I would suggest improving the recycling systems in place in all districts. To pay for that why not add a tax to each item that has a currently non recyclable status. So styrofoam could have a small tax that would pay for our recycling systems to handle this type of plastic.",

            "comment": "I took out our 2x monthly garbage containers this morning. They had one bag of compost ready waste and 2 small bags of garbage (all in single use plastic bags). \n\nThis is where the plastics waste management problem fails. Plastics are not the issue! What we do with them after they have ended their economic value to us, their buyers is the issue. Single use, multiple use, life supporting, greenhouse gas reducing, food saving, comfort creating, global warming reducing, etc. are all reasons for us purchasing plastics over other alternative products\/services. We are not being ignorant or stupid when we buy a product that is wholly or partially made of some type of plastic. We are making partially informed decisions about what is best for us, our families, our country, our planet; now and in the future.\n\nThe technology to recycle plastics is elementary. They are primarily hydrocarbon based and thus contain much unused energy. This could be extracted safely. There would be a cost to do this. Are we willing to pay that cost? To do  so would cut into the net benefit we now receive from using plastics. Maybe some would cease to to be viable (OK) or would have to increase in cost (user pays; OK). Since plastics are so widely distributed, the biggest cost in recycling plastics will always be the cost of capture, separation and collection, not the cost of reconverting it back to basic, safe molecules and compounds.\n\nWe can not contemplate the disruption of removing plastics from our lives than we can really understand the impact of extracting hydrocarbons from our lives.\n\n'Nature abhors a vacuum' but it also 'abhors an excess'. Lifeforms will eventually evolve that will recycle plastics just as they have eventually done for every atom and molecule ever created on earth. Unfortunately plastics are so new that only recently has Nature started creating enzymes and life forms that will consume plastics and leave behind residuals that are plant and animal friendly. We can help the process along and are doing so but have been losing the race through bad waste management practices by the human race.\n\nLook at your waste containers. Are you part of the poor waste management process that we need in place until Nature finally catches up with our chemical inventiveness?\n\nJim",

Then one day very recently,  i opened a box of pre-packacked lunch-bag ready snacks for my kids lunches. I looked a the little not quite plastic, not quite foil wrappers and thought where do these go? the landfill (or ocean) of course. Then I thought of how many parents opened the same or similar snack to put on their kids lunches and how many of those little wrappers were now out there and it made me sad. I think i was also blind to how much of our blue bin ends up in the landfill as well even though the plastic was deemed \"recyclable\".\n\n2. Ideally, all plastics should be fully recyclable and multi-use where applicable. More plastic alternatives such as glass or cardboard (depending on application) should be used.\n\nUltimately though, as individuals and consumers - we need to step back from the disposable society we've created for our own conveniences. We all need to be more aware of what our habits have and are creating.",

Plastic litter normally makes up about 40% of all materials littered on our streets. If this litter is not removed has the potential to get into storm drainage, our rivers and streams then the oceans. Picking up litter and street cleaning is a major cost to municipalities , and litter reduction is a cost saving proposition. There are very few litter management programs in Canada that have been effective. However, some municipalities like Winnipeg, Brandon, Edmonton and Toronto have made good progress with education and \"community pride\" campaigns to encourage proper disposal of litter. More needs to be done.",

The higher the tax, the less likely the plastic will be bought at the same rate. Customers of fast food chains and in grocery stores will have to pay much more for plastic items and most will choose another option. Work with local authorities on stricter enforcement of fines for throwing plastic or any other garbage outside.School environmental work is pathetic: on World Environment Day our \"eco\" school had ZERO initiatives while the yard is covered in garbage, mostly thrown by the kids, much of it - plastic. Education is huge and must be among the top priorities together with taxing plastic items. Work with big users like fast food chains, pop drinks and soda makers, etc. to have them on board to promote better options.",

I know that plastic can be the right choice when looking at the full lifecycle of energy consumption and greenhouse gas production however I also recognize that does not address the concern of plastic waste. I would like to see a requirement that all plastic packaging is recyclable or compostable. This allows some flexibility for the producer to determine what the best approach is for their products. Secondly it must be recognized that much of the onus is on the consumer to properly dispose of their plastics. Governments (municipal, provincial, federal) need to provide access to recycling depots and adequate collection to ensure that plastic trash does not end up in the environment. \nPlastics have many uses that are important for our health and safety such as sterile products for hospitals and smaller lightweight packages for items that need to be shipped (less burning of fossil fuels during transport) however we need to challenge ourselves when it comes to single use products. There needs to be options and I hope that we can find a material that will function similar to plastic but without the long lifespan (compostable) that could be used for single use needs.",

We need a better recycling program. There are many provinces (and even countries!) which do this already and with great success.  I understand that recycling costs money, however, how much money are you going to have to spend to clean up the bigger mess later? We aren't going to be able to print money when there are no more trees left.  \n\nI would like to see a ban on single use plastics.  We lived without the majority of these convenience items, we can live without them again.

This gives companies incentives to change their production and manufacturing standards. \n\n2) Announce a plan to have all non-emergency sectors move to fully biodegradable plastics by 2030. This can exclude sectors like medical and scientific research, as well as the medical industry as a whole since many of their products rely on using sterile plastic-based equipment or resources that have no cost-effective replacements. Companies must meet per-assigned goals on a 5 year basis, \n\n3) Much like beer or other liquors, announce that plastic water bottles and container now come with a deposit included in their price and that collecting facilities where plastic bottles or containers can be returned and recycled with a simultaneous return for the individual(s) returning the plastics. This would discourage waste in public areas. \n\n4) For those companies that are unable or hesitant to stop using non-biodegradeable plastics, implement a plan for them to sponsor (at their expense) industry competitions, where innovators from around the country can attempt to solve their reliance on plastics. They will face stiff financial penalties after 5 years if they have not held at least one competition\/fiscal year. If a competitor can resolve their reliance on plastics to the satisfaction of the Canadian Government, the company, and an impartial third party, the competitor gets a prize and the plastics can be taken off the production line.",

            "comment": "#1: I go to grocery stores that sell veggies and fruits without packaging (Coop) and bag them in reused plastic bags from bread bags or bagels bags. After they are worn out or dirty, I recycle them. \n\n#2: Many thoughts! \n\nA) Plastics are always too contaminated to get recycled. Because it's really hard to clean it, it\u2019s impossible to keep it in a high grade when going trhough recycling process. That's why the industry is saturated with bad grade plastic that have to be landfilled after one use. \n\nB) Plastics = Pollution everywhere. All shapes of single use plastics are huge pollutants (everywhere on earth really: forests and being eaten by sea animals) and because they breakdown in such little pieces (biodegradable and oxo even worse!), we are now also consuming it (https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2017\/sep\/08\/sea-salt-around-world-contaminated-by-plastic-studies)\n\n\nSOLUTION: The whole plastic jazz should be reviewed!\n\nGoing away from high negative impact single use products - Styrofoam for instance and promoting less impactfull products - Compostable and eatable plastics for instance (https:\/\/cosmosmagazine.com\/chemistry\/edible-plastic-food-wrappers-made-from-milk-and-fruit).\n\nHow? Option 1: Increasing taxes on production (manufacturers*), sell and buy (establishments and end users) of single use\/disposable plastics. Everyone will have to pay high taxes for it.\nManufactures*: Ask them what will they be producing out of raw materials, if it\u2019s disposable\/single use only, add a higher tax to it. Same approach as above, increasing taxes on every step of production and sell.\n\nResults: Market shift! More green products will have a bigger demand, so the prices will drop and then people and industries will end up choosing more \"divertable\" materials vs choosing Styrofoam and all because it\u2019s cheaper.\n\nCase Study: I am from Alberta and we are just recovering from a bad crisis where many business closed. Many food vendors rely on every cent they can save to keep their business running. They want to be more green, but Styrofoam is the cheapest option they have so they will keep buying it until they find something more cost-effective.\n\nHow? Option 2: Lowering taxes or giving grants to manufactures that are producing durable\/reusable products. Give grants to business that have a Circle-Economy or EPR business approaches. Give grants to business and people that are not producing waste.\n\nWhat do to with all that money gathered by high taxes or remaining taxes?\nPut on research on wider use for eatable and compostable plastics Or other ideas, there are so many awesome projects around the world with solutions for plastic diversion. All petroleum plastics should be completely replaced by other kinds of plastics that can be easily degraded by natural processes, so if they end up in nature, they will get reincorporated by nature and it will not be considered pollution.",

When I\u2019m purchasing groceries for my family, I\u2019m concerned about food safety, product freshness, and reduced food spoilage. Using the correct packaging is essential to delivering on these objectives.\n\nIn the case of plastic packaging specifically, these products are essential to a low-carbon economy. On top of improving shelf-life, protecting our products, and significantly reducing food waste, just think of the light weighting (fewer resources used) that is possible with plastics, the improved energy efficiency, and the avoided GHG emissions from transportation at every step of the supply chain. \n\nMoving forward, government, individuals, and industry must come together with a balanced approach that looks at the full life-cycle impacts of all products in the marketplace. As a country, we need to develop a robust, post-consumer strategy that ensures the end of life scenario for all products avoids our oceans and landscape. Plastics will play an important role in our future and we should encourage product innovation and research to drive these solutions at both ends of a product\u2019s life-cycle.",

Next I\u2019m giving up my beautiful liquid soaps which I absolutely love or at least buy the largest size I can. I am going to try Lush Shampoos and soaps to reduce plastic.

Trying to grocery shop with a cart full of 20 reusable bags left no room for the groceries. Children reuse the plastic bags for wet swim suits, outdoor nature collections, keeping their home made slime in, etc. Please do not ban plastic bags as they do serve a purpose!",

Plastics packaging is actually very sustainable material as it extends the shelf-life of food, reduces food waste (which is has a lot larger impact on the environment than plastics not being recycled), and reduces GHG emissions.  The challenge for plastics is not why they are used for packaging but how we can do a better job of diverting them from landfills at their end-of-life.",

Very significant negative impacts from plastics are frequently the result of human behavior (litter, reluctance to recycle), inadequate facilities to properly re-purpose plastic materials (recycle and reuse) and from a lack of recognition that plastics represent a finite and valuable resource.  We must stop generating plastics debris  - in our oceans, lakes, rivers and landscapes \u2013 in the same way that other sources of pollution are considered unacceptable. I am concerned that actions to ban the use of plastics will have further undesirable consequences to our environment and our well-being, and believe it entirely possible to shift behaviors and make the right investments (in recycling and reuse technologies) so that plastics can continue to be an important contributor to consumer\u2019s needs and a lower carbon economy.  Collaborative innovation, partnering industry, governments and community efforts are required.",

Therefore make choices to purchase\/use plastics that have a reuse quality to it; sturdy, thick enough to reuse or re-purpose. With this in mind, manufacturers can stop creating cheap, low grade plastics - and bioplastics (in certain products). Ex. in areas where plastic is necessary to improve food quality, reduce food waste; the plastic should be high grade so it can be reused\/re-purposed to wrap lunches or other food products once the initial use is finished. Bioplastics should not be in shopping bags or products where strength and quality are needed. Reserve such a chemistry for the little 'windows' in tissue and pasta boxes so the final complete package is compostable when the consumer is finished with it.  Basically, plastics manufacturers should stick to what they know and make it better, not branch out into odd chemistry and employing hemp, corn, begass, etc. . .leave biodegradable to the compostable experts and focus their chemistry talent on making better, higher quality, recyclable, reusable, plastic.",

I am a resident of Bayfield, ON and through the work of Blue Bayfield, the village became a Blue Community in 2015 and recently was recognized as being a plastic free community through Surfers against Sewage (a UK based environmental charity) . Following is the article: https:\/\/www.sas.org.uk\/news\/plastic-free-communities-goes-global\/\nIn the past few years, bottle-water refilling stations have been provided throughout the village including a mobile water refiling station on bicycle wheels available for public events, community forums and advocacy, information pieces in the local newspaper, recognition of the eateries and other establishments such as the Town Hall that have gone plastic-free, beach clean-ups etc. are just a few of the initiatives that have taken place. The government could support these initiatives through financial incentives and\/or a type of program similar to 'Canada blooms'. Recognize plastic-free communities and encourage others to do the same.  \n\n2) Ban single use plastic bags and drinking straws. These are not necessary and a ban would be of little inconvenience. Kenya banned the use of plastic bags a year ago and from a recent article in the Guardian, the impact has been very positive. \n\n3) Reduce the use of single use plastic water bottles. Make it less palatable for companies such as Nestle to take our municipal water by drastically increasing the costs, tax the sale of bottled water except in communities where bottled water is the only option and  ENSURE that this is never the situation. Every one has the right to clean drinking water so the use of bottled water should never be the necessity. \n4) At events such as the recent Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill, instead of providing bottled water to deal with the extreme heat, mobile water bottle refilling stations should have been made accessible. And have more permanent refilling stations as the need dictates. \n5) Work towards banning the use of styrofoam in packaging and using more biodegradable materials for packaging.",

            "comment": "I hate to sound like an old geezer but when I was a much younger man almost nothing was made of plastic. We had straws and toothpaste tubes and packaging that didn't involve plastic. My wife and I search out products that don't use plastic in their manufacture or packaging but it is almost impossible. There are creative solutions out there but without some legislation to motivate these innovations we won't see much traction. It wasn't that long ago that we were asked if we prefer paper or plastic bags at the grocery store. Grocery stores only offer plastic if you forget to bring your re-usable bag, which for me is almost all the time. Salad is now sold in plastic containers. It seems more pervasive, not less. People will always choose the path of least resistance. Without a legislative framework of either incentives or disincentives we will continue to drown in plastic.",

Although this is in the early stages, it does take time changing the mind of consumers to think about alternative products.  One of my creations is a lotion in a bar, this bar melts onto the skin just like lotion from a bottle.  The only difference is no plastic bottle.  I have lots of ideas to reduce plastic waste but these products take time and testing.  Sometimes we have to take a step back in time and ask what products were purchased that did not come in a plastic bottle, then manufacture that product in an innovative modern way.

We had a bronze age, then an iron age now its the plastic age. We use plastics to enhance our lives, reduce energy, and generally speaking make a better world. Let's understand that with the exception of cosmetics no manufacturer wants to pay for over packaging. Secondly plastic is in the oceans because humans put it there. Keep in mind that it has been reported that Bangladesh, India and China are the chief culprits. Why, because there is little in the way of recycling in those countries. The prime cause of plastic pollution is people and governments. People resist recycling and governments such as Canada would rather spend   4% of GDP on NATO yet nothing on trash recycling. Solution, simple, 2 steps Recycle, Reuse, Reduce. Next, put an environmental levy on all goods and services, and use that money to pay to recycl every product that goes to our land fill today.

I carry a jar in my purse for takeout coffee. I even re-use bags that I find lying around (when I walk my dog) as garbage bags. But over to you... To reduce plastic waste, the gov't could a) ban bottled water, which is a scam and a scourge on the environment; b) ban plastic bags and straws and all single use plastics (utensils, dishes, etc... people would adjust); c) ban bubble packs; d) hold gov't sponsored contests that challenge people to make art from plastic waste; e) Open a \"Ten thousand villages\" type arts and crafts store, gov't owned, like the SAQ, that sells products made from repurposed plastic; f) make astroturf illegal; g) levy a special tax on clothing made from plastics; h) forbid groceries from over packaging produce. Regarding improving plastic products, the point is, petroleum is a dead product made from death that is itself killing the world--there is no reason to \"improve\" plastics--better to ditch plastics and move on. So I would suggest that you rephrase your instructions to read, \"find viable alternatives to plastic products and packaging.\"",

            "comment": "Produce does not have to be put in a thin plastic bag while grocery shopping. And why does meat have to be double-wrapped in plastic? I've never had an issue when I decline that option. And some of those 'convenience' items such as hard boiled eggs or apples and kiwis that are wrapped in individual plastic containers for lunches? Crazy! \n\nWhat about limiting single-use items altogether? People can buy themselves a standard-sized bulk yogurt and spoon it into their own re-useable portion-sized container. It's not that much of an inconvenience. Costs for the larger items are usually lower, and would possibly decrease further if sized are standardized - due to decreased packaging costs. I'd also like to see grocer-supplied re-usable containers for bulk items (that already have been weighed to discount the container weight from the price). And I'd like to see the regulations to allow this - as well as permitting plastic cup reuse at sport arenas or events that sell beer or cider! Let us bring in our own containers for bulk items and give us a marginal discount for doing so, why not? They do this at the coffee shops. \n\nIf contamination is a concern, let the onus fall on the buyer if some sort of illness results from an unclean container. It could be a company policy which is stated on the bill, that items purchased with the buyer's container is their responsibility unless the source is proven to have originated the supplier's stock. We're adults and need to start taking responsibility and ownership for our own impact on our personal health and environment.",

            "comment": "Producers of plastic must take greater responsibility\n\nPlastic manufacturers are planning to increase production by almost a third over the next five years. In 1974, the average per capita plastic consumption was 2kg, today, it\u2019s 43kg.  Industries responsible for the major plastic wastes must be targeted with industry agreements and producer liability arrangements, with requirements for handling, collection and reuse of waste.\n\nAll goods should adhere to more strict packaging rules.  Introduce a carbon-based packaging tax to be paid by the manufacturer\/importer (not the Canadian consumer!) before goods can be sold. Yes, companies might pass on the price to consumers, but it will give the manufacturer an incentive to reduce their packaging or make it compostable to keep their costs down and their profits up. If the tax is added just at the end to consumers there is zero incentive for manufacturers to change what they do because it won't cost THEM anything. Consumers are already suffering enough.  This was done in the Netherlands.\n\nBan All Non-Compostable Single-Use Plastic \nSet a deadline date (maybe 2020) to ban the use and sale of non-compostable, single-use plastic bags, straws, cups, plates and cutlery in Canada.  Make an exception for 100% compostable alternatives to those items. Also mandate that compostable straws must be available on request by disabled people to avoid inconveniencing those who really need a straw. Start with a regulation which bans these single-use, non-compostable plastic items in chain restaurants and supermarkets in 2020, and then an overall ban in all dining outlets and stores by 2021.  \n\nKeep in mind, there is a BIG difference between biodegradable and compostable. Compostables leave no toxic residue while biodegradables break down into tiny bits of plastic.  Those tiny microplastic bits end up in our waterways, in the human body and in animals. Biodegradable plastic never disappears and any toxic additives they contain\u2014including flame retardants, antimicrobials, and plasticizers\u2014get released into the environment. Many of those toxins directly affect the endocrine systems of organisms, which control almost every cell in the body.  The regulation MUST transition us to 100% compostable plastic for single-use items.\n\nResearch shows the average operating 'lifespan' of single-use plastics to be approximately 20 minutes. Plastic bags can last in a landfill for up to 1000 years.  A car can drive 11 metres on the amount of petroleum used to make a single plastic bag.  An estimated 100,000 whales, seals, and turtles die every year as a result of eating or being trapped by plastic bags.  Lightweight plastic bags get blown into trees and other plants and can be mistaken for food by animals affecting their diet. \n\nMajor Flaw in Recycling Plastic as the Big Solution\n\n1. Not everyone is responsible. When we discovered that lead in gasoline was leading to acid rain, there was an education campaign and unleaded gas. Many people still chose to use leaded gas and gas stations kept selling it. To solve the crisis it had to be banned.  \n\n2. Most companies will simply carry on with petroleum-based plastics forever unless mandated otherwise.  Lego is working on a strong, durable, sturdy non-petroleum-based plastic for their product.  All companies must be mandated to do the same. 2040 is a reasonable date to set for this and will send a strong market signal.",

            "comment": "We're in a chicken and egg situation. Everywhere I shop, there are plastic bags and clamshell containers for every damn food\/produce. Sellers don't stop using them and consumers won't buy without them. Sadly plastic packaging is a tool for large-scale retailing, globalization, and capitalism. That increases our greed because we want produces to be available all year round and plastic packaging satisfies that need. Organic human relationship with food comes from respecting what's available in season. Now, although we have massive availability of produces from around the world, I don't know how my food is grown and producers don't know who buy their products. The same way I don't know my neighbours and baffled at my apartment complex's trash bin: People don't know how to sort and throw their trash.\n\nThe packaging problem must be solved two-pronged. Consumers need to rely less on it and companies must stop using it. What about a scenario where we strengthen each of our own community? Residential neighbours talking together, knowing each other and monitoring and educating each other for good practices. Similarly, a small, local retailing system where producers, sellers and consumers know each other fosters trust in the products, as well as communal and environmental bonds. \n\nMy wild questions are do you communicate to your neighbours? Is your community connected about those issues? How can we facilitate communities that care for one another's environmental living?",

However, this is not super convenient for many reasons: sanitation, price (very often is not cheaper!), this kind of stores are not very spread yet and well you have to plan very well to bring all the containers you need, and if you use glass containers it becomes very heavy. We don't need and don't want to own a car. So we do all waking or biking. We thought that plastic, aluminium and glass containers could be standardize and could carry a deposit (consigne).

Apply a subvention to products made with recycled materials. The government needs to do something concrete to change customers behaviors. Also, all packaging should be at least recyclabled plastics (no.1 to 5) if not recycled papers or cardboards.",

I cook from scratch, buy food from farmer's markets and make many of my own cleaning and grooming products partly to avoid plastic waste. I eat less meat and buy from a farmers market or a butcher because I don't like the plastic and styrofoam used to package meat in grocery stores. I don't believe recycling is the answer to the plastic waste problem and prefer reusable containers and packaging that can be safely composted. I also believe the companies selling their products in single use plastic containers should have to deal with the cost of recycling them. Perhaps if they were held responsible for the waste their products create, they would find more sustainable ways to deliver their products. I am willing to pay more for a product that does not create waste like milk sold in glass bottles. I spend time online reading blogs about zero plastic and zero waste and find many good ideas on how to reduce waste.  Recently I've decided I will purchase clothing made from natural fibers instead of synthetics.",

I would like them to step up and invest in innovative technology that could replace some versions of plastic i.e. things made with biodegradable materials. I would like to see an improvement in recycling. I know so little about recycling and whether or not my plastics even make it to the recycling plant. Individuals can only have so much power. Plastic is part of our system and unless larger stakeholders step up, we're going to continue having problems.\n\nI'd like to see more restaurants and food stores encouraging people to bring tupperware. I'd like to see a ban on plastic-wrapped produce in all grocery stores, from big chains to mom and pops. I'd like industries to stop relying so heavily on oil and gas industries to keep producing plastic items that are toxic to our environment and especially to ocean creatures. I'd like them to find a better way to replace all the jobs of people who create plastic packaging to earn a living to transition into a more sustainable, future-oriented means of life. \n\nIt would be amazing if Canada could start this, but the plastic packaging situation is dire in Asia, from developing countries like Indonesia to highly developed nations like Japan, who are notorious for their overuse in plastic packaging. It would be amazing if this wasn't deemed a \"liberal\" or \"leftist\" issue. This is an issue that affects all of humanity, no matter what your political stance is. I'd like all governments and industries - left, centre, right - to focus on combatting climate change by reducing plastic production overall. It is non-negotiable for our future at this point.",

There is a definite trend right now with corporations who are advertising their commitments to environmentalism (TB Bank, Occitane etc. ). I don't think corporations are going to go out of their way creating robust recycling plans and its up to the government to then step up and open the door, so to speak,  with  creative solutions that are mutually beneficial.  I believe once you purchase a product the whole product including packaging belongs to the consumer. The consumer then has the responsibility to recycle\/dispose and donate. The manufacturing industry is dying out and I believe there are still people who would benefit from this type of employment including people with disabilities. I would love to see a more productive chain of recycling facilities and some manufacturing facilities that can work with recyclable materials. It would be nice if corporations contributed and participated in this, and possibly received some sort of tax credit. This would lead to a sustainable future for everybody. If we keep moving forward in the same direction and take no action, everybody loses.",

This would ensure no one is sticking their hands in taste testing the bulk items causing cross contamination worries. With deli meats it\u2019s hard to say what the grocer feels comfortable with in their store perhaps each store could sell a certain container and then if you purchase it, your deli meats could be passed to you in waxed paper to place in your branded container.

None of these bags are recycled and nearly all of them end up in landfills.\n\nGarbage bags could easily be eliminated by going back to bulk garbage collection. The only downside would be increased odors and mess which were the reasons that they were invented in the first place. Otherwise, they serve no functional purpose in terms of decreasing the quantity of garbage that needs to be handled. Actually, they make garbage handling more complex due to their plastic compounds impeding the processing of bulk garbage.\n\nJim Knock\n.",

            "comment": "I have taken some time to read through as many comments below as i can, there are some gems! There is a lot of responsibility being put on consumers to change, government to implement outright bans and generic comments about a need for industry to produce better plastic products. \nWhile bans and levies can curb end-user behaviour and habits, this is not the only answer. The solution is three tiered: individuals, government and industry. Right now much of the extrinsic cost of plastic products falls onto the consumer - an non-measurable cost that must be absorbed by government and the tax payers (eg: municipal waste facilities and collection, environmental clean-ups run by non-profits). These cost of the negative effects on our environment are never considered. The amount of resources (non-renewable, petroleum based resources) used to create, and ship a single-use plastic bag or bottle is exuberant, and never considered. Industry has been allowed to remove, nay IGNORE, these true costs of making their plastic products . We have allowed a system that promotes the abuse of plastics, viewing plastic as \"cheap\" and \"inexpensive\" when really it is quite the opposite. \nThis disposable system has crept upwards beyond just a simple grocery bag or coffee cup. Industries (across all sectors) now take advantage of this throw-away society using Planned Obsolescence in their products, which originated from Gillette (thank you for that). From small consumer goods like phones, computers and clothing all the way up to vehicles, vehicle parts, household appliances and appliance parts and beyond! \nWhile I do see a small shift in my world to buy higher quality, longer lasting, and unpackaged items, there is very little regulation or ramifications that industry faces when adding to this throw-away society. \nI encourage everyone to start spending money wisely, some businesses will listen and adapt. But if we want change to really happen, regulations need to be set at the beginning of a product's life (bans and levies are at the end). ALL costs associated with the disposal of a product need to be proportionately redirected back manufacturers. Regulation fighting planned obsolescence would be great (EU is looking at this already). Clean-up costs of plastic in our oceans should be looked at more like a giant oil spill (we would never let Shell or BP get away with an oil spill of any size, why do large plastic manufacturers get away with it? Coca Cola, Nestle, Proctor & Gamble) Collaboration with the global governing leaders on fighting against this world-wide oil spill is essential. \n\nI look forward to seeing what Canada does to step up against plastic pollution. \n~ Briana, Plastic-Free YYC Ltd.",

Cette mesure permettrait de mettre plus de poids sur l'envie de r\u00e9duire la consommation de produits suremball\u00e9s.\n-Finalement, les municipalit\u00e9s et arrondissements se doivent de mettre de l'accent sur la protection de notre environnement.

There should be some fairly severe disincentives to move away from single use plastics especially in packaging and adverstising. In particular we need to promote alternatives such as paper and bulk. If there are more options and they are the cheaper options consumers will choose those. So it should come from that side of things.

            "comment": "I couldn\u2019t decide which area would best address the need to reduce our reliance on plastics and had to settle for \u201cSustainable design and production\u201d.  \nPlastics produced from fossil fuels only continues our need for this non-renewable resource.  \nBio-degradable (my definition is that the material only breaks down into smaller pieces of plastics) or compostable plastics rely on heat and\/or oxygen for degradation.  Many products touted as being compostable have never been pre-tested by the municipalities that would process these in their compost facilities and most have been rejected by the municipalities.  The manufacturers have only tested the products, under ideal conditions, in their own labs.  This greenwashing by manufacturers needs to stop as it misleads many consumers into believing that they're doing the right thing.  \nI'm showing my age when I say that when I was a child there was very little waste.  This was years before the blue box.  The blue box program came out of necessity as manufacturers increased the amount of packaging waste that they were generating putting a strain on our landfills and the municipalities that had to deal with this waste.  It\u2019s not just packaging waste as there is also a lot of printed paper in the waste stream.  Stores used to place ads in the newspaper, not as a separate flyer.  The electronic age was supposed to reduce our need to print which is a laughable concept now.\nThe government (and I'm going to say federal as somethings need to be regulated across the nation to be effective) needs to restrict where plastics can be used and this means no unnecessary use of this material.  \n\u2022\tSome of the over-packaging is a result of the need to increase product security but there are electronic ways to deal with this concern.  \n\u2022\tWhere packaging of fragile products is deemed absolutely necessary then use paper-based material.  I've heard of moulded pulp made from paper that had flecks of laminated plastic film throughout so this was apparently a lower grade moulded pulp.\n\u2022\tDo not laminate paper, which only makes the paper harder for the recycler to process!!  Incandescent light bulbs (quite fragile) used to be packaged in plain boxboard but some LEDs (not as fragile) are in boxes made of laminated paper.\n\u2022\tEnvelope windows used to be made of vellum and here I'm referring to the cellulose-based transparent material.  There is no need for plastic windows in envelopes or boxes.\n\u2022\tLet\u2019s restrict use of plastics to only those that have value in the blue box and thus are highly recyclable, good end markets and a source of revenue for the municipalities and material processors. This means in addition to glass and metal packaging we would only use PET and HDPE bottles as outlined in the link below. (https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/tale-two-systems-how-light-weight-packaging-impacts-box-lakhan-ph-d\/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BlJ5h62EySum%2FheA0PridEg%3D%3D).\n\u2022\tLet\u2019s go back to reusable packaging where we can e.g. glass bottles for milk and pop for local goods.\n\u2022\tThe fast food industry has embraced the single-use lifestyle and is largely responsible for the litter problem we have today.  You need to watch \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner\u201d to see how it used to be done.  If they use single-use packaging for items eaten outside of the restaurant then it must be compostable.  This would require compost programs be available everywhere.\n\u2022\tPaper straws need to replace single use plastic straws (or better yet have consumers use reusable ones).  Durable, reusable plastic straws should be available to those who cannot use metal or silicone straws. \n\u2022\tThere are 2 food courts in Toronto that have reusable dishes and cutlery and staff to sort the waste.\n\u2022\tSo much of the food packaged in plastic is not healthy so reducing this category would actually be a good thing.  \n\u2022\tTransportation costs have been given as reason to use plastics which are not as heavy as other materials but reducing the amount of packaging to begin with is a better choice.\nI know that a lot of the ideas posted here may be pipedreams but we need to reduce our need for pipelines.  I also understand that there are some uses for plastic for which we cannot easily find alternatives.",

One issue too is the weight of product at the curb is such that product tends to get \"blown away\" even though placed in a blue bin.......  Municipalities need provide \"enclosed\" containers (incorporated tops) which can\/would secure the content.  Green bins have such as a standard because of the need to prevent access by wildlife.............need the same for blue bins ...........  This will add to municipal costs due the potential need for upgrades for vehicles designed to pickup these units.............the overall improvement however far outweighs this cost............  The issue with enclosed bins then becomes the situation where they are overloaded which simply defeats the purpose - the solution to that is simply larger\/wheeled bins........",

The process is not always entirely clear as to what can be recycled and that may lead to people throwing items in the recycling that aren't accepted and can infect the entire process. If there was more clarity about what can and cannot be recycled, that may help recycling companies save money, help consumers recycle more effectively, and may lead to more push to recycle items that aren't currently being recycled.\n2) There are many countries that do recycling very effectively. Germany: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GM08JabFnpU. They use clear garbage bags, and if there is any recycled material they do not accept the trash, causing people to take recycling very seriously.\nIn terms of repurposing, there are a number of cases of effective plastic repurposing. One is a start up in the UK creating roads using plastic waste, which are cheaper, and less prone to pot holes. Funding these innovative solutions is one way governments can accelerate these processes.",

I  know from both experience and an active participation in the manufacturing industry tat the majority of the recycle industry is ineffective and inefficient. \n1.) The plastic products need to be managed full cycle. \n       *   There are both those that will recycle to the highest degree possible and those that could care less, there are also those that do not have the options because they do not have the tools to accomplish the recycle task. \n       *   There are not enough manufacturers in Canada that can take an item to be recycled and turn it back into a product for reuse. This causes shipping challenges and the customer base for recyclers is very low. This can cause turmoil when a country like China shuts its doors to highly contaminated product (specifically since Canada\/USA product recyclers have systems where high contamination is the norm).\n      * Management of recycle systems is in the hands of Municipal government in most cases. While they may have a role in regulations that guide and direct households and collect fees for services they are probably the least qualified and most inefficient in the industry to handle the management functions leading to a good recycle program.\n     * Plastic would be far more easily managed and separated if it were collected with no other products in the mix. (Single stream facilities are not the most effective plastic separation systems). \n    * Plastic items could be collected in many ways. I prefer to see a system set up that would allow those communities that want to recycle establish a system where the community could actually participate in the recycle effort and be rewarded for their participation. I would envision a system that would allow for a community drop off point providing the option for collection and shared revenue. The revenue could be easily tracked and provide funds directly back into the communities that most participated in the enterprise. .",

The disappointing thing is that we have no reprocessing industry. E.g. Plastics are bailed and sent to China. While the quality of the recycled materials collected by people is good with some the lowest contamination levels, sadly fewer people are taking part. There remains great ignorance about the value in recycling. Those who understand participate enthusiastically but the majority just do not seem to care. Public attitudes need to change and education is sadly lacking. Supermarkets could host large recycling collection containers as has been the case in the U.K. For 30 years - it works and also establishes a better link to consumer choices. Sham recycling by business as a \"feel good\" thing has to end.",

Obviously we need more leadership at a higher level than provincial to develop a plan to repurpose or create an end use for plastics. Our Community of 22 000 has done an amazing job of recycling, but the bales of plastic sit in the elements due to no place to send it, now that China is not accepting our Canadian products due to mismanagement at Canadian facilities, as per news articles saying facilities are slowing down the conveyor belts to be able to sort product more accurately. We need a place to send plastics within our province: pyrolysis for oil, sorted and granulated and formed into new plastic containers, flooring, roofing, siding, etc.  We must  encourage development of an end product and encourage its use in the marketplace.  Perhaps utilize Carbon tax revenue to get R&D mobilized, mandate post consumer waste must be processed within provincial boundaries",

Residents themselves are confused as to how to properly recycle items, not to mention people who are visiting Toronto.  \n\nThe fact that items must be cleaned before they can be recyled- i.e. food- is, I believe, a barrier to proper recycling. \n\nWhat about more use of glass containers, that can easily be recycled and resused?\n\nLet's ban single use plastic bags",

            "comment": "In Halifax, it is easier to dispose of plastics on the go as most streets have separated garbage receptacles. I find when I go visit my parents in Ontario, if I have an item on the go that needs to be recycled, I either need to carry it with me all day until I get home to properly recycle or put it in the trash bin. Making the change to separated receptacles along the street and in more public places could be a good way to get more people to recycle. \nHalifax also created an app to help you figure out which piece of trash goes where. You simply type in what you are looking at ditching and it tells you either landfill, recycle or compost. \nAdditionally, I have lived in an apartment building for the past 4 years and the biggest hurdle is getting residents in an big building to properly dispose of their trash. When you have single home trash, your trash simply won't be picked up if not sorted properly, but when your trash is collected as a collective, it is difficult to pinpoint who did it wrong and thus a lot of recyclables end up in the landfill. Finding a program that is easy and effective for big buildings in cities will also help limit landfills from filling up with recyclables.",

I feel like people should no longer be allowed to put out unlimited bags of garbage. It should be one bag every other week, and consumer should have to \"purchase\" tags for their garbage bags. If it ID'd individuals as to who owned the garbage, i feel like social pressure would move them in the right direction.You drive past some driveways and people have like 3 bags of garbage. That is so unacceptable. If people had a limit than there would be more pressure on companies to provide consumers with less wasteful options.",

Banning the production and use of new plastics would open up a market for recycling.  .\n\nAll the plastic we have ever made \u2014 maybe all the plastic we\u2019ll ever need \u2014 is still out there, floating the ocean. If Canada invested in creating facilities for plastics recycling, could coastal Canada not make a business of harvesting this ocean plastic for recycling?",

            "comment": "When visiting family in Norway two years ago, I was stunned to find they had a recycling program that included throwing every single piece of plastic in the recycling, whether it be #6 (styrene) forks\/coffee lids to those not-quite-rigid plastic bag containers that contain soft pasta like tortellini, to even soiled sandwich meat bags from the deli.  They said it didn't matter that it had meat residue on it, \"the recycling service takes it all and in any condition\".  I think if Norway can make something useful out of dirty plastic products then so can the rest of the world.  This whole deal about not accepting plastic shopping bags at the curb in BC \/ metro Vancouver because they might potentially have some water or food residue in them is a total lost opportunity.  We use reusable bags all the time and always keep some with us for spontaneous shopping but we still end up with loads of plastic bags from the inside of cereal boxes or produce bags from the grocery store, etc.  (yes we have the reusable produce bags too but they're heavy and the store never tares the scale before weighing the produce and the self check-out stands don't have a function to).  We save them in bundles and take them to the recycling centre, along with any Styrofoam we happen to accumulate from meat packaging or unpacking boxed goods, to the transfer station where they have free bag and styrofoam drop off.  I feel like we are probably 1:10,000 people who actually make the effort though.",

            "comment": "I have long advocated (to deaf ears, no matter where I've lived) that there should be a total ban on all single-use water bottles. it should be illegal to sell or purchase water in bottles of less than 4 litres. There is absolutely no reason that people need to use disposable single-use water bottles when there is such an abundance of re-usable bottles available.\nJustin Trudeau seemed to be annoyingly dismissive about a ban on plastic straws, but a no-plastic movement has to start somewhere. \"Back in the day\" straws were made of paper, not plastic. There is no reason we could not go back to paper again. If Justin just can't bring himself to ban plastic straws, then we should be required to specifically ask for a straw; they should not be handed out automatically at drive-throughs and should be kept behind the counter in restaurants. As well, there should be an additional charge for plastic straws. Those straws can actually be re-used if one takes the time to rinse them out after each use. Failing that, why not create designer re-usable (non-plastic) straws as was done for water bottles?\nFinally, provinces who do not already have a deposit \/ refund system for recyclables should be required to institute such a programme. This has a spin-off benefit of employing people at the refund \/ sorting centres. It may not dissuade people from buying plastics, but it would encourage recycling (to get your refund) rather than tossing recyclables (read - plastic bottles) into landfills. The deposit \/ refund system is already in place in Ontario for beer, wine & liquor bottles, so why have they not extended it to include other recyclables?",

            "comment": "The bottom line for me is that society and people's behavior won't change unless there is money at stake. Much like we do with cans & bottles, there needs to be a recycling deposit paid by the consumer on all single use plastics and product packaging. This money could to be used to facilitate and\/or subsidize private recycling facilities who actually recycle the materials (as opposed to shipping out of country). The deposit needs only be large enough to make a private recycling venture profitable, not to cover the whole cost. An added benefit if the fee is large enough would be to hopefully reduce general consumption of these materials which is the root cause of this issue.\nThe amount of the deposit would need to vary based on material types and packaging configuration and would probably have to be set by government.",

Using and creating packaging that can\u2019t be recycled should be illegal and the prohibition enforced. Indeed, it should be easy enough to recycle that companies can make a profit doing it. A set of federal standards could perhaps be established to incentivize the easy recycling of all packaging, discourage packaging that can\u2019t be reused or easily recycled,  and to prohibit packaging that can\u2019t be recycled.

Many of us might be recycling thinking we\u2019re doing it right but meanwhile we\u2019re not and our things are instead being dumped in a landfill. We need to know. People need to be reminded to recycle and reminded of what to recycle. And everywhere should have recycling separate from garbage. I was at a casual restaurant yesterday and they only had a garbage - and it was filled with cans and bottles. This is not organized and not acceptable in this day and age. Do we really want to keep contributing to the problem!?",

If people do need straws they can have reusable metal straws, just like many of us have re-usable thermos coffee cups.\n\n2. Carry out plastic bags should be banned immediately. If 'your' house is like ours we now have about 30 re-usable grocery bags ... some given for free e.g. from library, pet food store, heart and stroke, and others we have bought from metro. loblaws, MEc etc.\n\n3. Drinks like Tim Horton's ice caps which use plastic cups should use biodegadable plastic containers ... I have seen a toronto company 'greenshift' and a UK company that make them.\n\n4. Pop drink companies should be forced to have a returnable policy of plastic and metal cans  like the lcbo and Beer stores in ontario. users \/producers of these products should have to pay for there waste.\n\n5. styrofoam which never breaks apart either should be banned.\n\n6. I don't have suggestion for coffee take out lids  ... reusable cups may not be answer as I am sure would destroy business model for takeout windows, if we all idled our cars for longer as we wait for our reusable cups to be filled. unless we make the lids reusable and force chains to have drop off bins and they have to wash them, but there might be some safety problems there.... I see some companies are moving away from black plastic lids (not recyclable in Toronto) which is good. Maybe some smart person has a solution. Minimum suggestion put a price on plastic pollution like carbon tax and use money to clean water ways.\n\n7. If possible eliminate black plastic which is not recyclable. (Dont know if possible)",

I know that it affects companies that produce the containers they are planted in now, but we need to think more along the lines of repurposing before recycling.

Clearly the answer lies not only in improving recycling technology, but on a more long-term sustainable level, it involves a reduction in plastic-use and plastic production (as unpopular as that may be).  \nIn the short\/medium-term, I think having more recycling bins in public spaces would help.  Just on my own street there is plastic waste lining the street, and I live in a quiet area on a small street.  \nI also think it might be helpful if we went back to the old days of sorting our recycling, but we need to hear from the recycling companies how we can better manage our waste.",

I first learned how to recycle in primary school, I am now 24, and a lot of new kinds of plastics and packaging have emerged since then, and sometimes I and other people I know, don't know exactly where it goes. \n2. Having also having lived in Europe (Germany), there was a system where any plastic bottle purchased was charged also a deposit and so required people to return their own bottles (to the grocery store, the machines are in almost every one) to get it back. At the store itself, the bottles are smashed and collected to ensure they go to the right place. Anything glass went in bins located around the neighbourhood where individuals had to sort their glass products into white\/brown\/green glass and once filled, the city collected the class. All other waste was collected from households (mostly apartments), which each has a plastic, compost, garbage, and paper bins. Wrong disposal in these bins meant the household was later billed in the mail by the city. I think this is a great system which ensures people are responsible for their waste.",

It's madness to allow straws and plastic bags that may be used for a few minutes only to pollute the environment forever. A ban is the most effective way to change behaviours and to force companies such as Neslte and McDonalds to invest in the development and use of bioplastics. We are facing an unmitigated crisis with plastic turning up in everything from tap water to food, and found everywhere from seashores to seafloors. The government needs to take drastic action, action based on the interests of people and the planet, not on those of the oil and plastics industry. Canada is lagging behind many other jurisdictions that have shown leadership. The time to act is now.",

There are \"where does it go?\" webpages on municipal websites that can help with sorting plastics, however, these methods require people to take the initiative to search it up. Maybe better labeling on the bins provided by the municipalities can help improve education. \n\nBetter sorting systems that reduce consumer effort can improve diversion rates and collection. Having systems that contain the plastics from environmental factors such as wind can retain more recyclables. Designing closed bins like the Region of Peel has can reduce the waste entering streets and natural areas.\n\nRepurposing plastic can support packaging. Collaboration between the waste sector and the private sector can help create a circular economy.",

As such, I often find that people don't actually know what is or isn't recyclable plastic. As for the programs, there are recycling programs for plastics, but I feel they are inadequate. They don't recycle nearly enough of the plastics that we use. Almost everything in my garbage bin is some kind of plastic packaging and that is a serious issue that needs to be fixed. People either need to be educated about plastics recycling, or the government could implement a specific labeling system that makes it easy for people to sort their plastics. Another option would be to ban the use of non-recyclable plastics entirely, but this might not be very feasible... We could also promote the use of alternative packaging such as packaging that is biodegradable and this could help reduce the amount of plastics in packaging.",

These bins usually get stuffed way over capacity and everything starts spilling out over the top. This leads to a lot of litter that ends up on the streets that could eventually find their way into waterways and eventually the ocean. Littering also leads to the same kind of result. It's a problem that seems a bit difficult to solve since getting rid of public trash cans might not be the best solution (it could potentially lead to more littering). We definitely need to cut down on single use plastics and find a way to recycle coffee cups and the like which are lined with plastic (these seem to be the most common culprits of the overflowing public trash can).",

In a small province like New Brunswick, this becomes very confusing to consumers. I am well-educated, I've downloaded the app, I stay in touch with updates, and yet I am regularly confused about what I am meant to recycle. Once something is tossed in the bin, there is no feedback to find out whether we made the correct choice or not so there is no way to learn when we fail. (Or perhaps that is when the system fails?) Plus, I don't have confidence that most recycling is very good for the environment anyway. Isn't it more about \"downcycling\"? I would much prefer an aggressive strategy to minimize and eliminate plastics altogether than to emphasize more recycling.",

But it's frustrating when I do a roadside cleanup near my home to pick up fully recyclable plastic containers when I can see two recycling bins from where I'm picking them up.  Let's not kid ourselves; if we ban plastics that means we will be picking up more broken bottles that people will toss away.  And if we tell people that packages are compostable they will throw them into the environment even more even though they need industrial composting to break down. We need to make good decisions about the best material for the job, and then convince people that throwing things on the ground when they are finished with them is just not okay.",

Why are there not local options?\n\n3) I do like that City of Calgary has simplified recycling by including plastics 1-7 because there is better uptake.  It's unfortunate that citizens feel a little lied to when they find out that only a few of those classes are actually recyclable.",

Communities in my area have a focus on recycling and management of materials at end-of-life. I think the lack of awareness and education on the first part of the waste hierarchy is likely a symptom of lack of provincial leadership and funding. I also believe the diversity of programs across the province causes a significant amount of confusion for residents.\n2. I think for small provinces like NB, there would be significant benefit in a provincial system for recycling where all regions recycled the same materials and marketed all collected materials together. This would not only simplify the program for residents, but it would allow smaller regions to take advantage of larger regional programs where perhaps they could not afford to implement their own program. Perhaps this will come in the form of a provincial PPP EPR program like those already in place in Quebec, BC, Ontario, Etc. I think this type of program would be best implemented across the Atlantic Provinces to allow for development of recycling markets in Atlantic Canada and access to economies of scale when sorting, processing, and marketing materials. This would certainly move quicker with a good push from the Federal Government.",

If we do nothing to reduce the amount of waste we produce or to ensure that we provide recyclable and compostable feedstock that can be properly recovered\/used, then we should not be surprised when our waste system is failing. I don't think it's fair to put everything on the facilities that sort\/process these materials.

But since there is no legislation about this waste, a majority gets dumped in full without regard to compost or recycle. Seems a bit careless.But it might be a factor into donating the food whether or not the retailer wants to sort the food out of the plastic or just have someone from a charity organization pick it up, and distribute or freeze.

We also have an eco-centre where we can bring larger items (including plastics) for proper disposal. Other than adding a monetary value to plastics I feel like we have a pretty good system in place in my area, lots of people just need to learn how to properly use it.",

Even though it was originally meant to be the final stage of a product after its lifecycle has been thoroughly exhausted. Instead we use recycling as a means to make ourselves feel better about the waste we create as long as we believe it is going to be recycled. Our aim should initially be to produce fewer products, use the products that we do make last long term, and then eventually retire them to be recycled. As it stands now, many products that claim to be recyclable are minimally so. So either more energy will ultimately go into them to break them down and create new products, or only a small percentage of a product is legitimately recyclable. \n\nCreate fewer products, make them long lasting and fully recyclable.",

A lot of restaurants will give you take-out in black plastic dishes which then have to go in the garbage.  This is a big issue for me because I do Lunch and Learn presentations for work and sometimes I provide meals for up to 30 people at a time.  I have asked my caterer to make up large platters of food and I supply paper plates and biodegradable cutlery but there has to be a better solution than this.\nAlso, please, for the love of Pete can we not just all agree to use either paper straws or no straws at all?",

The community hosts electronic waste events for disposal, and has a household hazardous waste depot.  They are easy and free. \n\nPlastics can be better collected by implementing a composting and recycling program in the community. When you have to pay for garbage collection, there is more incentive to recycle.  In unorganized communities, where there is no curbside pick up, there is no convenience to recycling and plastic may be burnt along with other garbage for disposal purposes.  \n\nPlastics can be better collected if communities had recycle bins along with garbage bins placed along sidewalks and in parks, etc.",

            "comment": "Excitingly, RecycleBC in British Columbia has started a pilot program to recycle flexible plastics, with hopes to expand it province-wide in the coming year. (Info here: https:\/\/recyclebc.ca\/recycle-bc-phasing-in-collection-of-other-flexible-plastic-packaging\/) Unfortunately, some major challenges are faced in municipalities with dischord between Residential and ICI sector waste collection services and media. To this end, groups like the SLRD and Metro Vancouver have developed standardized signs and icons to share with businesses. (See and explore these resources here: http:\/\/www.metrovancouver.org\/services\/solid-waste\/recycling-signage-campaigns\/recycling-signage-colours\/Pages\/default.aspx, and https:\/\/www.slrd.bc.ca\/services\/recycling-composting-waste-landfill\/recycling-signage-colour-scheme).  Challenges arise with communicating these needs effectively to businesses and homes, especially where municipal budgets in growing BC communities can only stretch so far and can't hire enough staff to run effective media and outreach. This is so frustrating! If Canada wants to help, they can grant small and growing municipalities funds to hire human resources to improve their waste management systems. In addition, it would be so great if BC could stop shipping recyclables overseas, and greater pressures were placed on large, high-waste corporations to contribute locally to waste management development (maybe this is where some additional resources funds could come from? Hm.) As others have said here, there are so many great ideas and innovative solutions, that there needs to be improved funding and coordination in waste management.",

Just think of all the plastic that would end of where it should if this were the case everywhere.

The report highlighted how one contaminated container can cause a whole batch to be diverted to a land-fill. I think I took for granted that what I put in my blue bin actually got recycled. \n\nWhile I think education and awareness campaigns would be helpful, because you can never fully control what individuals do I think that the facilities and processes that make up recycling have to accommodate that. I also read in the report that things like black plastic is difficult to recycle because it's not \"recognized\" by many of the automated sorters. In this instance either the automation needs to be improved or we need to re-think if black plastic should be manufactured in the first place.",

I see that China is clamping down on waste imports now, but sadly the economics of plastics recycling have made it unfeasible in countries like Canada.   One solution that cross-cuts with innovation is to find a closed-loop process to recycle plastics back into their components.  Difficult with so many additives and plasticizers but I was excited to see the following in the news awhile ago (discovery of enzyme that could completely breakdown plastics)  so maybe there is hope! http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/technology\/plastic-eating-enzyme-pollution-1.4622923\n\nI would also love to suggest some economic instruments that could be used but they would be hard to implement, both on a practical and political level (e.g. provincial deposit-refund schemes to incentivize collection\/discourage litter, surtaxes on plastic packaging to discourage their use by business.)",

Rather than \"banning\" products we need to establish effective ways to recover value after they have served their purpose. It starts with a comprehensive collection program.  Some post consumer plastics can be sorted and directed to another useful purpose.  Those that can't (mixed plastics, heavy contamination, etc) still retain a high energy value that can be recovered cleanly and responsibly.  The reason plastics are so popular is that there are few if any other materials that will match the performance and value of plastics.  As a society we need to accept the responsibility of completing the useful cycle of all materials that we use.",

Plastic can be very easy to recycle, repurpose, or upcycle into other valuable products \u2013 we must focus our energy on collecting and managing these valuable resources.\n\nCanada should devise a national plan for recycling and collection facilities.

There are so many complex issues around global markets for all products, not just plastic recycling, but can Canada PLEASE look into developing more and more recycling facilities in our own country? No matter the refinement stage, we have a huge market for plastics recycling that we could tap into from ourselves and from the US, and the less distance the plastic have to travel overseas, the less chance there is for plastic to be lost to the ocean in the shipping and storing stages. I recently visited a recycling transfer station in Squamish, BC, and i was so sad because the company was forced to store its plastic outdoors because the overseas market had closed (due to their own challenges!) and the facility had no where else to store it until they could find a broker to purchase the baled plastics. In the meantime, wind and rain break apart the bales and plastic - even though it was properly sorted by the community residents - ends up in Howe Sound and the ocean.",

            "comment": "I am glad that we are able to voice our opinions about this. In my opinion, there is a lot that individuals can do to reduce plastic waste, but it is important that the issue is being tackled at a higher level too. \n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves is how BC is handling recycling programs. To save money (yay!), fewer and fewer things are being accepted for curbside pick-up (boo!). Continually downloading the responsibility of recycling onto citizens creates barriers to effective recycling. For example, plastic bags can only be accepted by certain facilities that a citizen would have to travel to. The irony is that all of our recycling must be contained inside a blue plastic bag (and yet, compostable bags are not accepted with yard waste\/green bins)...As recycling programs get more complicated, the rate at which we successfully recycle items (if at all) is likely to decrease. In my city (Abbotsford), there are several recycling depots, but they do not all accept the same items. What depots can and cannot accept changed multiple times recently due to changes in provincial\/city programs. This is confusing, and also means that residents are expected to travel to recycle certain items. While this is feasible for me, it is not for many. \n\nSo, what can be done? I would love to see some level of government ban single-use plastic bags altogether. This removes the burden from both residents and recycling facilities (in my case), but also hopefully reduces the number of bags winding up polluting our oceans.\n\nI would also love to see improvements in our recycling programs, not just a financial improvement, but in a way that makes sense for residents. I had the 'luxury' of recycling in SW Ontario (Kitchener\/Waterloo) for 6 years and I think the only thing I really had to worry about was whether there was any grease on a pizza box (which meant it couldn't be collected). Instead of single-use bags, they use blue bins. One household would have two bins (or more, you could put out as much as you want): one for cardboard\/paper and one for containers (plastic\/glass\/metal). This was so much saner than blue bags here in BC. \n\nMaybe we can take all the plastic from blue bags and make recycled recycling bins out of them. \n\nMaybe we should not let Old Navy sell thousands of pairs of $1 flip-flops that wind up in the garbage after one summer. \n\nEtc.",

            "comment": "Canadians consume 2% of the world's total volume of plastic annually. A recent publication by the Economist highlighted in March of 2018 that only 9% of global plastic consumption is recycled, with the remaining ending up in landfills. Both figures are truly startling, In light of these facts, my company SEI Logistics Ltd. has been evaluating the feasibility of operating small-scale Waste-to-energy facilities on Canadian Landfill sites and Transfer Stations. Plasma Gasification is a proven technology, whereby a feedstock composed of hydrocarbon chains (plastics, food waste, etc.) is processed into base elements through extreme heat. Hydrogen or Synthetic Natural gas (Syngas) is fed to a gas turbine to produce electricity. Carbon or slack, a material similar to coal with embedded impurities has a 1:100 volume of the feedstock following gasification, which can be either disposed at a landfill or used in the production of asphalt. \nAlthough a clear solution to reducing plastic pollution is reducing plastic consumption, this is a fallacy. Society will only continue to consume single-use petroleum-derived plastics at near exponential rates until the underlying supply chain incorporates new materials. Examples of this include biodegradable fungal plastics, which will only be incorporated when cost competitive to petroleum-derived plastics at scale. \nI therefore see Plasma Gasification as our greatest weapon in the fight to reducing plastics entering the Canadian Environment. How? By processing all recyclables and Municipal waste (mostly stored in plastic garbage bags) brought or currently stored in landfills, we eliminate all new and old plastics from entering our oceans in the future. Although recycling efforts are noble, many Canadians still accidentally throw away plastics in municipal waste bins, which are brought to landfills. Small Plasma Gasification systems only cost 2 Million Dollars CAD to build. They produce a significant source of electricity, which will act as both the source of the power to operate the facility with all excess sold to the Canadian Grid at a profit. \nSEI Logistics Ltd. is dedicated to building a demonstration project in 2020 in Northern Alberta or BC, whereby we hope to process 10 tonnes of minicipal waste per day. The syngas produced will feed a 500KW gas turbine.\nMany thanks,\nEric",

Plastics, however, are polluting the environment in an increasingly visible way, where once barely noticeable, shorelines, parks, and rivers are now overrun. As an environmentalist, industrialist and conservationist who cares greatly for the protection of our natural ecosystems, I wish to use this platform as a means to criticize conventional recycling programs and broadcast the bright future in Waste-to-energy initiatives. In Canada, through our best efforts, we only manage to recycle 12% of our total consumed plastics, of which less than 0.1% is re-used; The remaining is sent to landfill. Although a difficult fact to digest, in reality, this pales in comparison to developing nations, where simple municipal waste disposal is not properly managed, resulting in fires, groundwater contamination, and dumping into rivers. The truth is, we as humans do not enjoy cleaning up after ourselves, and for many years, have gone so far as to ship waste to foreign soil for disposal. As a 24 Year Old, although thrilled that our policymakers were willing to experiment recycling initiatives, this strategy has proven to be greatly destructive and in the end futile. Knowing how bad the issue has become, I recommend we begin destroying all waste before it has the chance of entering the environment altogether. Although Large Waste-to-energy facilities are in operation near major Canadian cities, the technologies and techniques have not yet been adopted by municipalities, townships, and villages. By mandating or supporting Waste-to-energy infrastructure developments rather than recycling or transfer stations, we could simultaneously produce renewable electricity and eliminate the possibility of plastics entering landfills, rivers, and oceans. Ideally, as we transition towards the use of a biodegradable material superior to plastic, I see a future where old landfills are mined for plastics in order to fuel gasification plants. I have provided a link to a video I thought was particularly informative on the subject. I look forward to seeing your comments. \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RS7IzU2VJIQ\n\nEric Little, Winner of Youth Can Do It 2018 and Prime Minister Youth Council Candidate 2017",

End users should not be required to sort plastics by type as this is often not marked on the plastic. For example in my co-op community we separate from the garbage stream all soft plastics that are not accepted in the blue box and send for recycling privately. This is not available in many villages or towns that are too small for the required facilities. These communities should receive subsidies paid for form the sale of recyclable material so they can ship all plastics to a convenient regional or provincial location that can separate the material into the appropriate types for sale back to the chemical manufacturers for recycling.

            "comment": "When it comes to opportunities to prevent plastics marine litter, collection and management is one of our biggest opportunities as Canadians:\n\n1) Producers need to continue to innovate to enable improved product performance, so end use products can be down-gauged. Innovation also needs to drive improved collection and recyclability, ultimately improving the value of recycled material. It would be great to our government invest in innovation in this space, along with an increased focus at the producer level. \n\n2) Much of the world's marine debris originates outside of Canada via jurisdictions without strong waste management infrastructure. I'd like to see our Canadian government use its global influence via the multi-national platforms in which they participate to continue to help improve global waste management. \n\n3) I think it needs to be recognized society at large needs to take more accountability. Litter is a behavior issue so as long as there's a need for the utility that plastics provide, there's a potential for those products to end up where they don't belong in our environment if people are irresponsible. Community clean up events are a great way to give the opportunity for anyone to step their game up, or even just picking up trash you see when going about your daily activities.",

This causes a lot of confusion among residents. \nWe also find issue with just a single stream recycling. It is such a huge problem for everyone because it makes people to not care at all. Very frequently recycling is so contaminated that it looks more like trash. Another issue is residents do not know where their recycling or trash REALLY ends up! I work in this field and even I myself have no idea where my waste goes. If it is in China, why there and where exactly? What does the site really look like? If it is in the USA, again where exactly? What are the environmental regulations in the places where waste such as recycling ends up? \nAnother huge issue is companies such as Waste Management telling us to put everything together including: paper, mixed recycling, garbage. Then they tell us that they separate everything. How is this even possible? Electronics and gadgets, they are all placed together with the blue box contents. Sometimes people don't know where things go and just throw it in the garbage. \n\nSolutions:\nSingle stream doesn't work. Users of recycling such as plastic need to be educated and fined if they are not recycling correctly. \nProducers of plastic packaging have to create recycable end products.\nSingle use plastics should be banned.\nMaking furniture out of recycled plastic.",

To motivate the consumer to return the packaging to source, a substantial refundable packaging deposit must be levied. The consumer nor the municipality should never be on the hook for disposal or recycling like we have today. The source of the packaging must be made responsible for the disposition of the packaging. Firm declining caps on the amount of returned packaging that may be disposed of should be implemented, with allowance trading or offsets trading to smooth the transition to zero waste. Manufacturers\/distributors\/retailers faced with having to receive packaging back, storing that packaging, shipping it back to source, etc will be MOTIVATED to push back up the supply change the message that single use and unnecessary packaging is not acceptable. The economy can correct this if there is a price of packaging! No different than a price on carbon or other pollution. Innovation springs from the opportunities revealed by constraints. The government needs to firmly implement market-based constraints as above to expedite a transition to zero waste. This applies not JUST to plastics, but to ALL waste. Use this mechanism, implement it in stages, and use caps and trade to stage the transition in the most economically optimum manner. Innovation in response to constraints will open up new economic activity and drive efficiencies. Money talks.",

The university of Hamburg in Germany has studied a fluidized bed reactor used to make plastic cracking. The sorting of raw materials is to select the raw materials suitable for cracking from the waste plastics. PVC should be removed because heating will cause hydrogen chloride to damage the equipment. 2. The crushing and cracking of plastics, through over-heating cracking or catalytic cracking in this process, makes plastics cracking and breaking of macromolecular polymer c-c bonds into small molecular hydrocarbons. The reaction in this process is very complicated and difficult to control. It produces a lot of gas and a lot of coke. Fillers and flame retardants in plastics can also affect the process. 3.

            "comment": "An important way to raise awareness is through our education system. We are now in ''reaction-mode'' to try and clean-up the beaches, streets, etc.  However, if we teach the future generations about how to care for our planet, we are preventing negative actions such as littering and wastefulness, and we would be encouraging environment action and care.  \nIn terms of things that would help me to make more sustainable choices, I first needed to learn about the problem of plastic waste.  Before seeing a movie about it, I had no idea of the impact, and I considered myself quite environmentally aware.  Such videos (i.e. Plastic Oceans) should be shown in schools.  Children come home and talk about what they learned to their parents, and then they want to involve their parents in sustainable choices, this is great way to prevent future damage to our ecosystems.  \nI would also make more sustainable choices when local government takes away my plastic options.  For example, the plastic bag ban in Montreal forces me to remember to bring my re-usable bag.  Eventually, this policy re-shapes my own habits, and in a little while, it will be completely normal for me to remember to bring my bag with me, and the same would be true for any other plastic ban.  It is a change in habit that is the most difficult, but once we get used to it, we don't remember that it was mildly inconvenient at first.",

It's easy to think that the plastic product that is light and perhaps not recyclable like a plastic food pouch is less sustainable. But when you compare it to glass or metal over its lifecycle its easy to see that the plastic product is the smart environmental choice by a big margin. But it's hard today for consumers to get that information.  As consumers we need to make better informed choices.",

They were recyclable, reusable, and considered bad for the environment because of the number of trees that were being lost to the consumer.  So we went to plastic everything, because it wasn't wasteful; now we know that plastic wastes.  Why don't we look to the past for answers to replacing plastic.   Here are some ideas.....\n - Paper bags instead of plastic.  They have the benefit of being recyclable, and they have lots of uses included wrapping paper and book protectors.\n- Reusable lunch boxes, cardboard when possible for takeout.  Some recycling centres would have to make adjustments given that these would not always been clean paper.\n- Go back to glass for large milk and juice containers.  We used to send these back for cleaning and reuse, but even if the glass was simply recycled, it would be less harmful to the environment than the plastic that we have now.\n\nI'm sure there lots of other ideas in history that can help us with this issue.  It would take some time, and ingenuity but the past is a valuable resource to learn from.",

            "comment": "i) Reusable produce bags are a very important part of my plastic reduction strategy. I have 12 reusable produce bags and there have been many grocery trips where I have used them all! It would probably help if grocery stores sold reusable produce bags near the single-use plastic ones to remind consumers that a choice is available.\n\nii) I try to consider if a food item can be purchased in bulk, like seeds and nuts. If so, I bring my own reusable container. For a long time, I would reuse disposable sandwich bags when purchasing items in bulk, but they would really begin to show their wear after four or five uses. I recently discovered silicone reusable sandwich bags that can be reused thousands of times. \n\niii) I have a backpack loaded with reusable shopping bags, produce bags, bulk bags, and other containers. I have learned that going grocery shopping begins by making sure I have that backpack. \n\niv) The way I learned how to shop for groceries was largely determined by watching the habits of others, who would go to the grocery store with no supplies and expect the store to provide all the bags and storage containers. It took YEARS for the message that this is wrong to actually sink in, largely because I had to unlearn a negative habit and discipline myself into adopting a positive habit. There were also social perception concerns. Ten years ago, someone walking into a grocery store with a backpack and then reaching into it 20 times while shopping would immediately arouse shoplifting suspicions. A lot of people still think this way, so it actually takes a certain amount of bravery to do an activity that was once viewed with scrutiny. It is wonderful that public awareness about reusable bags has made it socially acceptable to have a backpack while shopping,\n\nv) A picture of my backpack and the reusable items is provided on the Noticeboard. Notice that a laundry drying rack is used for the produce bags, and a plastic bag drying rack is used for the sandwich bags. Cleaning the reusable items is an important part of the process!\n\nvi) Public awareness and education is really important to help shoppers change their habits. I recently saw reusable bags that had a message on the bag saying \"This is the bag I always forget\", which was a clever reminder!\n\nvii) Churches and their congregations are concerned about the environment, so it is likely that education campaigns for changing shopping habits may be well-received and actually adopted by those spiritually motivated to care for the planet. A few years ago, there was a presentation at my church discussing the moral imperative to buy fair trade products, and it really moved me to adopt that shopping habit.",

The packaging options out there but they are more expensive and not nearly as widely used as of yet. The only problem then becomes when people try to recycle these natural polymers with plastic as it degrades the plastic products that are going into the recycling stream. If there was better policy to eliminate plastics all together then this problem of not knowing what can and cannot be recycled wouldn't exist as it would all just be 100% biodegradable.  It is not just up to policy makers to change things\/policy to solve the issue but up to us as well. Bringing your own containers and refusing to use one time use products will help speed up the rate of these changes.",

And as I begin to try and promote it myself, I realize that I was not alone in my ignorance. I want to say that a small 3% of the people I'm around on a daily basis (that includes customers, and associates) are aware of the choices they make that impact this planet. And not only do they utilize green options (using cloth bags for their purchases ..ect..), we share. I talk to them all the time about how to be greener, thanking them for their efforts. There are people who do try. Why is this? Because they are informed. And as much as I promote critical thinking, I also realize the desperate need to change things rather drastically.

I like to think that I consciously try to make sustainable decisions, even if they are somewhat inconvenient to me, however I definitely still choose the convenient, unsustainable option many times.  Sustainable options need to be made easier for Canadians to learn about and access. Many of these options (to me, at least), do not seem that difficult a concept, but just need a change in mindset from what has been the status quo for a long time.  Making sustainable lifestyles more convenient could include:\n-reduce plastic packaging in products, especially those that do not need it (i.e. produce, single-part items such as scissors, etc.)\n-provide alternatives to plastic packaging that are both easy to access and not exorbitantly expensive  (i.e. display cloth produce bags in produce section of grocery store, carry metal drinking straws as opposed to plastic ones, carry cloth feminine hygiene products as an alternative to disposable ones, etc.).  This should be done in all major stores, not just small independent ones where customers have to actively seek them out (which many do not have the knowledge or time to do)\n- create more bike lanes- and SAFE ones!  I for one would love to bike more, however my city is decidedly not bike friendly.  I did a 40-minute bike commute to work last year, and felt unsafe for about half the journey, due to complete lack of bike lanes on both major roadways and older, smaller ones that were narrow and unmaintained, as well as bike lanes that were too narrow and unseparated from roadways.  If SAFE bike lanes were more prevalent, I can guarantee many more people would bike (nearly everyone I've discussed this with has said they would love to be able to bike to work\/school\/anywhere in the city, but is too afraid to do so).\n-reduce restrictions on those who want to choose sustainable options such as front-yard gardens, backyard chickens, etc.  It seems ridiculous in this day and age that there are still bylaws in certain places that prevent people from planting vegetable gardens on their front lawns or boulevards because some believe that they are not aesthetically pleasing.  If someone wants to plant a garden or have backyard chickens, yes there needs to be some considerations (i.e. not obscuring visibility for traffic, not disturbing neighbours with roosters etc.), but there shouldn't be the amount of red tape that there currently is, based solely on \"lawn vanity.\"\n-",

Furthermore, local bulk buying stores must be prioritized over foreign-owned box stores. These box stores (Walmart, etc) must be heavily taxed and monitored for their use of unnecessary plastic, and pushed towards making more sustainable choices as only then will it be economically feasible for manufacturers to change. Better yet - prioritize local, zero waste businesses and ideally move toward sustainable communities that do not rely on Walmart, etc.",

Many times there are no options except to buy a product with plastic packaging. \n\nChanging our use of plastic is going to take a seismic shift of thinking. Most people use plastic in their daily lives without giving it much thought. They don't know that plastic never disappears or that its filling our oceans. This is in addition to the garbage in our landfills or simply on the streets as litter. \n\nMany years ago in Texas, the state needed to get their citizens thinking differently about litter so they came up with the \"Don't mess with Texas\" campaign. Suddenly the people has pride in their landscape and littering became a no-no. We need to do the same with plastic.",

We need to be more aware and responsible about the products we produce. Wrapping paper should either not be a thing or all wrapping paper should be recyclable, same goes for any unavoidable plastic use it should be able to be easily recycled. Plastic straws should not be a thing! Return to plastic drink containers. Ban plastic containers, use glass. Go back to paper bags in grocery stores. I understand the fear of cross pollination with hemp crops but green houses are a thing. We could be replacing the majority of our plastics with hemp plastics. We have a responsibility to help clean up our oceans! Our government needs to start taking action, making steps towards a cleaner, greener  Canada I live in a city that is just in the trial period of our recycling program it's 2018! Every city every town EVERY municipality should have a government regulated recycling program including compost. Take some money out of the budget to really educate people what goes into recycling to reduce wasteful costs of contaminated recycling. Don't allow the production of plastics that cannot be recycled. We have had too much resistance to the implementation of our recycling program, this means people don't care and the only reason people don't care is because they don't understand the cost and the drastic effects of not doing something. Ban plastic straws in restaurants and plastic bags in grocery stores. If they are not accessible people won't use them. Myself included. I'm horrible at remembering my reusable bags but if I didn't have an other option you bet I would learn quickly! We need to work towards a responsible consumer but I don't see that happening if we don't have a responsible government and we have a long way to go. Yes it will cost money and alot of it, but I think the alternative costs are much greater.",

Too many kids and not enough shovels etc. If we don\u2019t teach the next generation what it means to sustain, they won\u2019t care for it. \n\nI think that it\u2019s important to remember that the burden should not be placed on the citizen about choices and plastic. When your working, raising kids and juggling life, you grab what you can afford and what\u2019s easy. Not everyone is a die hard environmentalist, but people try to recycle.",

Universities have done a good job to implement new refill friendly fountains.\n\nI believe a cultural shift is required. You seem to need more time and money help sustain. I know people who litter because they feel their country is not helping them, so why should they go out their way.

And businesses that innovate environmentally friendly choices can't compete with the price of cheap plastics, and the public can't afford the better options. I know this because a friend went out of business selling environmentally friendly,  cruelty-free furniture. \n\nFor example, TV productions are sometimes sponsored by the Government of Canada. Why can't the government subsidize\/sponsor more sustainable products to lower the price and enhance availability in the market?  Once this happens, the long-standing plastic manufacturers that have all the equipment, will use their own formula and produce a similar environmentally friendly product and lower the price even more. The business will remain intact. This is how business works, competitiveness. Otherwise, we just talk about changes but are not pushing for them. If hospitals and government organizations are using single-use products such as styrofoam, what can be expected of everyone else?\n\nStart to build environmentally friendly communities. In the U.S. these types of communities are viewed as enclaves for the rich. With the proposed National Housing Strategy this is an opportunity to showcase sustainable building with community features. Help change actions and choices.",

Many alternative sustainable choices need to be hunted down and only the most devoted know about them or can find them: bamboo toothbrushes that will decompose, silk dental floss which will also decompose, paper wrapped toilet paper, bidet use (popular in Europe but almost unheard of in Canada).  \n\nPlastic packaging is cheap and seems to have helped some dominant companies gain the most valuable market shelf space. There should be a program where signs are designed pointing out products with more sustainable packaging or with single product packaging that is universally accepted in Canada for recycling (e.g. NOT a cardboard box or bag with a plastic window, NOT a plastic tub with a lid made out of a different plastic.). The companies who already pay the store for prime real estate can still have their real estate, they just won't receive the signage if their packaging does not meet the criteria set. Stores who use these signs can receive some sort of recognition, tax discount, or other reward for posting them. Online and in flyers they can advertise their participation and have this be a market advantage for them..  In turn, this would encourage all companies to rethink their packaging and design something more sustainable because they will get free in-store promotion. And when it comes down to it, for the company's it's all about the money and reputation.\n\nAnd the general population will have better, more sustainable options pointed out to them in the location where they make many\/most of their purchase decision.  In the end it's sort of like the ingredient and nutrition label for packaging.",

This idea would be similar to \"Food Safe\" in Ontario, where there is a certificate posted on restaurant doors that they passed a cleanliness inspection. I have heard recently that schools have high lead in water, and of course there are cases that come up (after the fact) of tainted tap water and illness, due to industry activity. And that the sewage system over flows during storms. I think this type of monitoring would ensure the public that the water is safe, and discourage purchasing water bottles for more sustainable choices. I am aware in my province you can bring your water from your home for free testing, so this would still be available for home owners. I have heard for Brita filtration systems to work the filter has to be replaced every two weeks. I still drink boiled and tap water because I believe its clean and that the flouride is good for me, but I can see how fast the water sells at store. So there must be misconceptions to address about water in Ontario,  if people are willing to buy what is available for free- despite the plastic water bottles which material could potentially affect human health, habitat and environment. I have heard the culture in BC is different and people drink the water without hesitation. \n \nIn addition, I am not happy with my by-law mandated, \"low flush toilet\" in my apartment. The toilets need to be flushed 3 times to work and this is causing the number  1 maintenance request. Consider this happening over 16 floors.  Everyone has decided its ridiculous. I am concerned this will eventually cause more problems and makes me not want to drink the tap water, even though I realize these are separate plumbing.",

Packaging symbols could help relieve that stress point.\nI personally would support restaurants and coffee shops that give a large discount on bringing your own travel mug or dishes. Starbucks gives a discount of ten cents to use your own cup.  If the government helped to change this incentive to 50 cents or more you would see many consumers choosing to bring their own cups and dishware.  The coffee houses could just make the paper cup drinks 50 cents higher.  Once we starting choosing to bring your own travel mug then the change will become a habit and will influence our peers and their choices.   Children are taught to recycle in school and at home but they have to see it in restaurants and other businesses that they frequent, it has to become everyday ...... hopefully like electric cars will someday be the norm and not the exception.",

Instead, I think better options would be to look at ways to reuse plastic as much as possible and to recycle more plastic materials.  Specifically, I\u2019d love to see investments in research to find cost effective ways to recycle Styrofoam or mixed plastics.

Many studies have shown that if we replaced the products made with plastics today with traditional materials such as glass and metal, the environmental impacts would be up to four times greater - that doesn't sound to sustainable to me.  In fact, biodegradable packaging is not better.  Does anyone want to see tons of biodegradable packaging in the forest? For these to be biodegradable, they need to be in an ideal environment of heat, water, soil, etc.  Not just anywhere.  Which means we would end up with our environment more littered than ever.  Plus people need to understand how energy and water intensive biodegradable polymer manufacturing is.  And do we really want to grow corn, sugarcane, and other crops to make plastic products or to feed the world population that is chronically undernourished? Feeding people should be our priority.\n\nI think what we need is clear labeling on how to recycle.  There is a program in the US called how2recycle, which inform consumers on the different steps to take to properly recycle their plastic product. Another example is the Caps On program to remind people to keep the plastic caps on the plastic bottles when they put them in the recycle bin.  If people have the information on how to handle their plastic products when they are done with them, I think we will see higher recycling rates.",

Our Government should also be investing in campaigns such as: 1) an educational campaign about the benefits of plastics including educating and encouraging people to reuse and recycle more. 2) To increase waste and proper disposal of plastics our Government should be investing in towns that can't afford or sustain proper recycling programs 3) A lot of Canadians are misinformed about the benefits of plastics. Our Canadian Government should do their homework on the benefits and kick-start a promotional campaign about \"How plastics can make our lives better\". This educational campaign could certainly be combined with  proper disposal and re-use. 4) Another investment for our Canadian Government to consider is encouraging more research innovation by offering incentives. 5) Support an initiative to validate or re-validate the root cause of marine debris and invest in a resolution (meaning: provide support to third-world countries and lobby other thriving countries to do the same). 6) Finally, if our Government isn\u2019t currently supporting, seeking advice from and collaborating with major industry associations like Chemistry Industry of Canada and Canadian Plastics Industry Association, this should be another consideration as part of their action plan.",

As we are one of the wealthy country in the world not only we can lead by example, we should feel obligated to be pioneers in this domain.  \n1) I believe, with regards to education, it needs to start at the source, in school and family houses, as well as industries.  Canadians are over consuming and we have to start asking fundamental questions, before the purchase is even considered or made.  We are at the point that recycling is clearly no longer sufficient.  The cycle, in this specific order, should be Need - Reuse - Dispose ( Recycle \/ Donate before considering waste).   Therefore, before we even want to purchase a product, we should ask our self: do I actually need this item?  what will I benefit or my family of this purchase?  Then, before sending it to recycling, is there another usage for this item before I dispose of it?  Can I donate this item before a more evasive approach?  \n2) simply policies or laws to impose significant changes: plastic bag banished from retail and grocery stores if they are not compostable; same with disposable products such as Styrofoam coffee cups, and plastic plates).  \n3) Stimulate industries that prone more bulk store where you can bring your containers and reward program for members that do so.  \n4) Advertisement : since we are doing it for tobacco (showing pictures of the impact of purchasing a product (wasteland, time of decomposition, etc.) as opposed to another (example, the Styrofoam for egg container as opposed to cardboard if cannot be banished) \n5) consider alternatives than wastelands, that finishes in the ocean such as the Netherlands, that invited a machine to produce combustible from waste.  \nWe are privileged; we should be more responsible.",

Other places have signs that say that they will gladly accept any travel mug - and give you a $0.25 incentive to do so.

Public education on 'recycling' is over simplified and leads most people to believe that down-cycling and incineration are the same as true recycling. If a single-use plastic can be completely recycled or up-cycled, the carbon foot print of the good if often smaller than using alternative materials.

There are also plethora of practical, cost-efficient ways for businesses to transition to sustainable takeout packaging.

For example, I have a black plastic take out container that has a recycling symbol located on the bottom of it. However, in my recycling guide, delivered to me by the city of Toronto, it states that black plastics, including take out containers, are not recyclable and should be thrown out. This conflicting information is confusing for people, resulting in black plastics being put incorrectly into recycling. Furthermore, the non-recyclable black plastic is being manufactured in Canada!",

The majority of people operate \"in the now\" as in, what is most convenient and cost effective for me right now? \n\nSure - that bento-style lunch box from that high-end eco-store might last you 5 - 10 years but it's $30 and I don't have $30 right now but I do have $1.99 to spend on zip-lock style sandwich bags. Of course, you'll end up spending more in the long run and contribute that much more to the landfill but in the moment $30 is too much to spend. \n\nIf the change is perceived as too difficult or too expensive - it won't work.\n\nSo, how do we create incentives to increase adoption of more sustainable choices?. Alternatively, we could create dis-incentives for bad habits i.e. the $ per garbage bag whereas recycling and composting\/green bin is \"free\".",

Most people by default are still going to choose the easiest, most convenient and cheapest option even if it's the worst option from an environmental perspective.\n\nI feel part of the reason we're in this mess is the infiltration of dollar stores and cheap plastic goods. We buy it because it's cheap. not because it will last but because it's cheap and we can just throw it out. I know i myself have purchased something from a dollar store not caring if i got it back or if it broke in a day or two because it was a dollar and who cares about a dollar and i could just throw it out and buy a new one. I am part of the problem!\n\nTo that end, changing consumer mindset and behaviours will not happen easily or overnight that's why i think some government intervention might be warranted for example the case against plastic straws. I love the idea of banning disposable plastic straws - it's a simple enough move and people will get used to it and for those truly hooked on straws there are paper and reusable options - done and done. \n\nPlastic bags are a bit trickier because in my experience - even though identified as \"single-use\" most people I know reuse them as garbage bags, lunch bags etc. But again, if the option was removed - we would adapt accordingly...",

I don't blame people (most of the time) for \"being lazy\" because in the Lower Mainland, it is HARD to recycle! A key challenge is that there are so many options, people are being asked to choose between as few as 4 or as many as 8 different waste streams at the \"best\" public disposal stations, or else not being asked to choose at all at many others. Putting pressure on individuals can be helpful, but it still results in so much contamination that currently, the market for recyclable plastics overseas has closed to BC because they are facing their own challenges with volume and contamination (blaming \"those Asians\" as I've seen in some comments here are absolutely unfair an unacceptable). I also don't believe that simply \"banning\" plastics is the answer, because all of our well-living depends on them, no matter our class or privileges. What the Canadian government could really help with is to limit of course the quantity of extra-packaging plastics allowed in industries (who sell to consumers), but also the types of plastics and variety of materials that are produced\/imported. If all types of waste and packaging items were standardized and reduced in variety, people who want to recycle would not be forced to decide between so many choices (which inevitably results in mistakes), and people who don't care about recycling would be provided with very simple and easy choices to make through appropriate media campaigns. We want simpler systems and simpler solutions to make recycling easy.",

Very few items need packaging and when they have to be packaged (electronic items, for example), they should be in biodegradable plastic or bamboo. We also need a better recycling program that will allow us to recycle everything. Very few people are clear on how to recycle, let alone, what to recycle. Look at Japan's recycling program. They can and do recycle everything. \n\nThere should be a tax on corporations to use less packaging and there needs to be a cultural shift so that consumers use less one-time use plastics and use recyclable choices. For example, it should be mainstream for people to bring mason jars into No Frills and be able to buy oats by bulk. Or if we want to buy strawberries, we should be able to bring our own bag and use that, instead of a one-time use plastic bag.",

Not only this, but consumers are already balancing many factors when making decisions about their purchases: health, quality, origin\/'localness' of product, ethical production conditions, convenience, cost, etc. \n\nCanadian policy should move us to systems that make it easier to stop purchasing single use plastics and provide incentives to do so. The feasibility of different options such as purchasing in bulk, phasing out plastic bags and single-use plastics, moving to other materials, etc. should be considered. If these options are more expensive, then government should consider how it can support businesses and individuals to adopt better practices.",

Rather than putting the burden solely on the consumer to filter through the sustainable and unsustainable, there should also be responsibility on producers to provide those options. As an example, I believe customers have a responsibility to use re-usable grocery bags, but producers have a responsibility to make those available for purchase, and also to dis-incentivize plastic bags (either through fees for purchase, or by making them unavailable).\n\nI would like to see more choice of packing products available - e.g. cardboard berry clamshells instead of plastic, paper bags for fruit and vegetables instead of plastic, and condiments\/dressings\/oils\/other packaged in glass instead of plastic. \n\nEasy to understand labelling is also a big help - being able to determine immediately if something is recyclable or compostable.",

Government regulations need to be in place to control the manufacture and use of goods.  While some would see this as a \u201cnanny state\u201d it is something that needs to be adopted.  Reducing the types of packaging manufactured will reduce the waste generated and make it easier for Canadians to use their blue box properly.\nRemove use of toxic plastics.  I laugh at parents who choose organic baby food but don\u2019t care that the packaging is of unknown toxicity (plastic pouches) and\/or not recyclable.",

            "comment": "I would like Canada to walk the talk.  It's time to invest in HEMP  which would replace all plastics.  It's biodegradable and eco-friendly.  Hemp can make up to 25,000 different types of products from paper to construction building.  It takes very little time for it to grow in fields and we wouldn't have to resort to cutting down our much needed forests.  We have the ability to take hemp and run with it.  Currently, the Alaskan Governor is signing a bill to put a hemp pilot program in place.  I'm also very disappointed that our current government recently gave NOVA Chemicals, a plastics company 35 million dollars.  Plastics are wreaking damage to our environment and will continually do so for future generations.  We should be investing in clean, sustainable, biodegradable practices and solutions.",

Assistance in catalyzing market demand for alternative products that meet functional requirements (i.e. are safe, light-weight, durable, able to be branded, etc.) could go a long way to curb the pollution problem resulting from this sector and economic activity.\n1) Vinyl banners - Recycled content, non-PVC, recyclable alternatives needed that also withstand weather.\n2) Adhesive vinyl signage - Similar to above. Not aware of any market-ready solution to this as present.\n3) Foamcore signs - There is no need for it when recyclable cardboard or polypropylene exist for varied applications.\n4) Shrinkwrap - Not aware of any market-ready solution yet.\n5) Visqueen - Non-reinforced recyclable alternatives exist, but are not commonly used due to durability issues. Reinforced material is very problematic to manage.\n6) Vinyl name badge holders - Elimination helps, but could do a better job of eliminating PVC in favour of durable or recyclable plastic alternatives.\n7) Disposable plastic bottles - Particularly at large festivals where dehydration possible. This is a health and safety issue that cannot be overcome by simply asking people to bring their own bottle. Effective recycling is essential here, and perhaps creative ways to promote refilling.",

The next generation, the Milennials, are too. I think the plastics issue is no longer a consumer issue, its a producer issue. In 2018, we are drowning in unrecyclable packaging.  When is it the packaging producer's responsibility to provide recyclable material to contain their goods? When does it become the retailer's responsibility to provide their goods in recyclable packaging?  Why on earth (pardon the pun) must we buy meat that is on Styrofoam trays that go straight to the garbage?  So our meat doesn't tilt and drip?  Ludicrous!  I would like my government to start regulating packaging, demanding change from producers and retailers.  The public is doing their part, producers and sellers are not.",

There is no \"away\" so looking at ways to burn plastic, hide it in other products like asphalt or feed it to some organism to break down will only lead to further pollution that is even harder to clean up (and likely contaminate any system we do have that are working well now).  So new solutions should look at policies to restrict the flows of materials that we cannot handle at the end of life; making producers responsible;  ways to change the system that encourages better design, longer lasting products made of better materials; and how to change behaviour and systems to make it easier for the products and materials to cycle back into the same products and materials.",

So many people are quick to assume that recycling is the be-all, end-all solution and that glass, metal, and paper packaging are better for the environment than plastics. I think we would benefit from really knowing what kind of impact production, use, recovery and recycling of all these materials really has on our environment. Production of paper products may be more harmful than plastics because of water use, chemicals, etc. What about glass? Transportation of heavy glass uses more fuel than plastic and recycling glass may be more harmful than making new glass with the cleaning\/sanitizing that is required. I've heard all these arguments from a multitude of sources and it's difficult to know who to trust.",

            "comment": "The facts that are shared here about the damages that plastics makes to oceans are true. However, there is another side to story. We should ask ourselves this question that why plastics have become an integral part of our everyday life? That is simply due to comfort, safety and many advantages that they have over other alternatives. Plastics plays a vital role in food packaging and as a result reducing food waste (which can create methane which has a higher environmental impact from GHG point of view). Plastics reduce the cost and carbon food print associated with transportation of goods. The advantages of plastics are many.... But let's go back to the problem we are facing. How we can ELIMINATE plastics litter? I think we have to spend on sustainable solutions like fully circular economy, meaning reduce the timing for degradability of plastics that go to consumer applications. Imagine a plastic bottle or a plastic bag that can be converted back to its building blocks (i.e. monomers). This requires research and development. Governments can think about policies that plastic producers and other stakeholders spend a percentage of their annual profit dedicated to research on this specific topic. NSERC or other government organizations can start creating research chairs or consortiums dedicated to fully circular economy for plastics. There are much more ideas.... The key is to create an environment that governments, resin manufacturers, plastic goods and articles producers, academia and consumers all take ownership in the problem and we have a focal leadership point that drives the programs in a systematic and disciplined manner. Need in the mother of invention. If we believe that there is a need to resolve the problem, the solution will be found soon or late. I want it to happen sooner and am ready to help in any way possible.",

By this I mean breaking down the plastic polymers into their constituent monomers.  Most monomers are either gas or liquid, so they could be filtered and otherwise clean up to make new plastics that are as good as the first time around.  Perhaps there is a need to develop new polymers that are particularly amenable to this process and still work well as plastics.  \n\nIf this could be done in a way that is cost effective and was widely used, scrap plastic would take on value like scrap metal, this would motivate recycling.",

Why are they more harmful? Can they be modified so that nature will reduce them naturally like it does virtually all other carbon based molecules?\n\nWhen I consider these questions, I keep coming back to the realization that plastics were created because, among other characteristics, they do not decompose easily! If we modify them so they do readily decompose, they cease to be useful for many current applications. Thus, their design is the underlying cause for their waste management problems. If we eliminate this characteristic, we significantly reduce their utility.\n\nAnother consideration is that plastics are new. They have existed for less than a century. I would propose that Nature will have found naturally produced enzymes and bacteria that will break down plastics just as has occurred through normal evolution  for virtually every energy rich compound ever produced on the planet. I fact I recently read that the Japanese have isolated a naturally occurring enzyme that does this and is actively being propagated at several major NA universities. \n\nMaybe we are currently in a brief interregnum where plastics have yet to be consumed by Natural forces since such forces are yet to be created (naturally or artificially).\n\nIn the meantime, we need to 'harvest' plastics until such natural 'scavengers' propagate.\n\nJim",

I've been to music festival where all of the cups, plates, eating utensils were made of corn and felt and looked just like regular plastic. Perhaps the bags could be made of hemp instead of corn. \n Why are we not all using plastic bags that can be composted.  I buy bags that I use as liners in my compost pail, and they are accepted by my municipal organic waste.  Several stores that I shop from also have these bags.  We should get all stores to use these biodegradable bags instead of ones that don't break down.l",

Instead of focusing on developing these kind of plastics, researchers should find ways to develop alternatives to plastics (e.g. compostable, wooden cutlery) that should result in a cheaper price. The major reason that many facilities do not switch to more eco-friendly materials over plastic is due to the price. In addition to stopping more produce of plastics, research should also be on getting rid of what humans have already produced. E.g. breaking down a plastic straw that is already made. \n  Also, develop education programs, that do not exactly fit under the category of research\/innovation but it is mandatory. Great amount of the population that is careless toward the issue is due to lack of awareness. Yes most people understand there is climate change and dying nature and all that, but they do not know the importance of their actions to actively participate. Education on subjects such as how to recycle (where things go, think before you throw, the numbers on the plastic, alternatives to plastic) should be implemented as a crucial part of schooling. Recycling and reducing waste is a habit that needs to be formed.",

Only pure product would be acceptable and profited share would be distributed to the contributors.

Municipalities would support such an operation by ensuring locations had proper zoning and stayed out of any management associated with the business.",

Cities should invest in more robust waste collection systems. On the streets here, I rarely see public garbage cans, let along public recycling bins. Of course this would only manage waste and not reduce it. Perhaps public pressure should be applied to coffee shops to give bigger incentives when customers bring reusable mugs. I also think we have to invest in more waste management staff, yes, that means taxes but it is also an investment into tourism. Noone wants to come to a dirty city, it causes reputational damage. The investment could go into low tech solutions, sidewalk and individual street garbage collectors.",

If we don't actually teach Ecological Literacy in school, from K - 12, we'll have to resort to more drastic measures. We don't actually teach Ecological Literacy  because it's not it's own subject. So we're doing it wrong. Some aspects are addressed, but imbedded in other subjects, complex and interconnected ecosystem knowledge of ecosystems is broken into bits.  taught in t isolation, and unless it's a school-wide initiative, this teaching is kind of actually optional. It relies on the passion of individual teachers, and the rest is at best, ecological tokenism and virtue signaling. Much of what we teach is, of course, species-centric, i.e., what can we use a tree for, vs what are the rights of a tree or a species or a forest. So, provinces need federal direction to establish Ecological Literacy as a subject, and Ministries, Boards of Education, and schools need to adopt green hiring and promotion policies.",

Single packaging for example single kraft slices need to be stoped and used only when necessary. Encouraging everyone to buy locally form a butcher( normally uses paper rap) or Farmers ( harvest vegetables). This reduces the plastic used during shipment. From field to table. Schools should make it mandatory for the students to pick up waste for the 40 hours volunteer work they need to graduate high school. Pay the homeless to pick up trash. People on welfare should do a minimum of hours picking up garbage and waste.",

Most of the bins right outside a coffee shop are full of single use cups showing that most people could have had a reusable mug and returned it to the shop as they did not go more than five paces away. Have Extended Producer Responsibility program be responsible for all the products (not just those returned) so that if beverage containers were a litter issue, the program would have to pay for litter clean up. The same should be in place for fishing gear -an EPR program funded by new sales and part of the program mandate is to collect the missing or ghost gear.",

Pour certains usages du plastique, cela suffit d'essayer simplement de sensibiliser. La plupart des gens ne changent leur habitude que lorsqu'ils n'ont plus le choix. Ainsi, je crois que les gouvernements devraient imiter Vancouver en continuant \u00e0 bannir plusieurs produits en plastique \u00e0 usage unique, tels que les bouteilles d'eau, les sacs en plastique, les pailles, les gobelets \u00e0 caf\u00e9 non recyclable et les gobelets en plastique pour les boissons froides. Puis, les restaurateurs devraient augmenter quelque peu le prix de certains produits (caf\u00e9, caf\u00e9 glac\u00e9, slush, smoothie, etc), afin de pouvoir offrir un rabais consid\u00e9rable lorsque le client apporte un sac ou un contenant r\u00e9utilisable.  \u00c9videmment, pour ce faire, les r\u00e8gles de salubrit\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre moins strictes et revues pour que les employ\u00e9s sachent comment s'y prendre. Par exemple, Bulk Barn a longtemps refus\u00e9 les contenants r\u00e9utilisables sous un pr\u00e9texte d'hygi\u00e8ne. Cela fait maintenant un an que nos pots sont accept\u00e9s et aucun probl\u00e8me n'est survenu. C'est souvent plus simple et moins dangereux qu'on ne le croit. Aussi, chaque restaurant de type fast food devrait avoir un lave-vaisselle, ainsi que de la vaisselle r\u00e9utilisable. Aussi, je vois de trop nombreux restaurants qui ont de la vaisselle r\u00e9utilisable, mais qui s'en servent peu.  Les employ\u00e9s doivent donc \u00eatre form\u00e9s \u00e0 servir chaque client qui mangent sur place avec de la vaisselle. En effet, le fait de mentionner qu'on mange ou qu'on boit sur place n'est pas suffisant pour se faire servir avec de la vaisselle r\u00e9utilisable. Il faut toujours le mentionner et, dans ce temps-l\u00e0, peu de gens le font. Voil\u00e0:)!\n-------------------------------------\nSometimes, I think we have to force change when it is necessary. For some uses of plastic, this is enough to simply try to raise awareness. Most people change their habits only when they have no choice. For example, I believe governments should emulate Vancouver and continue to ban several single-use plastic products, such as water bottles, plastic bags, straws, non-recyclable coffee cups, and plastic cups for cold drinks. Then, restaurateurs should increase the price of certain products (coffee, iced coffee, slush, smoothie, etc.) to a considerable discount when the customer brings a reusable bag or container. Obviously, to do this, health rules must be less stringent and reviewed so that employees know how to do it. For example, Bulk Barn has long refused reusable containers under the pretext of hygiene. It's been a year now that our pots are accepted and no problem has occurred. It's often simpler and less dangerous than people think. Also, every fast food restaurant should have a dishwasher, as well as reusable dishes. Also, I see too many restaurants that have reusable dishes, but they use little. Employees must therefore be trained to serve every customer who eat on the spot with dishes. Indeed, the fact of mentioning that we eat or drink on the spot is not enough to be served with reusable dishes. It must always be mentioned, and in that time, few people do it. Voil\u00e0!",

Group brainstorming activities focusing on how to protect the planet could be part of the curriculum. \n\nSimilarly, all businesses and corporations with a Human Respurces department must allocate 2-4 hours reviewing environmental policies with employees and must submit forms to the Federal government on how the company is adhering to standards of environmental stewardship.\n\nAt the community level, events organized by the city, such as group Plastic clean up, plastic-free Awards and public education campaigns might be a way to involve community.",

            "comment": "I believe tighter controls on use of plastic packaging would be helpful. Everything you buy is packaged for the convenience of display in the store and often means plastic is used for this purpose but is non-essential. Alternatives can be legislated. In addition, I believe the first easy step to take would be elimination of plastic water bottles. A decisive action to outlaw plastic water bottles would be of immediate benefit to the environment. We lived without them when I was growing up and certainly can return to drinking and storing water in different ways that do not involve the sale in small plastic bottles. A cup under the tap works! Fort McMurray stores do not package anything in plastic bags. People bring a tote bag if they wish. Perhaps other communities could implement the same. Habits can change as they did in Fort McMurray.",

At the very least, the cafeteria within our building should provide less plastic options (especially single-use) and more compostable and reusable options (e.g. glass juice containers, paper straws, compostable plates, etc.). It's very unfortunate that we don't have the ability to compost in our building, as that would be a great first step in diverting a lot of waste from landfills. I hope that in this movement to reduce plastic litter, we can improve our own organization greatly. In the long-run we may also see some economic benefits. While this is definitely easier said than done, it would serve as an example to the rest of Canada on how feasible zero-waste can be.",

In Canada, we need to focus on recycling all plastics across the country.  The majority of plastics can be recycled and made into other useful items.  Plastics are receiving a bad rep but we must consider all the advantages that come along with these products.  For example, polystyrene containers (foam) they are great for storage of food items, they are good for keeping food items warm and are extremely sanitary.  These products are less expensive to make, use less in energy to manufacture and are 98% air.  Foam products are 100% recyclable.  We need to focus our efforts on more recycling of plastics that will overall help the environment and create jobs in Canada.",

The goal is to collect PRODUCT and return the product back into the economy at the highest value possible. Street garbage will be not be part of our raw resource target. \nThe business model proposed at the moment would allow non-government community groups, association and not-for-profits to take part in the community segment of the Value Chain with the intention of directing funds directly back into the community the product came from, giving each community a direct reward through participation. The operational component of the plan would be managed by a separate entity providing operational activities to support the concept as well as tracking and financial management.",

The monitoring and enforcement would create a lot of jobs! Maybe even a public reporting mechanism so that consumers are aware of those businesses, who are not being responsible corporate citizens, and can spend their money elsewhere. \n\nFor fast food manufacturing, compostable containers or EDIBLE containers would be much better than plastic or styrofoam.\n\nWhen I buy eggs or produce from farmers markets and roadside stands, I bring back the cartons and pails. They are happy to take them back because they reuse them and it saves them money.\n\nConsumers and end users should be able to return plastics for reuse back to the manufacturer.

Many suggestions sound good but on closer examination they will create more waste and GHG's leading to accelerated climate change and including acidification of our oceans caused by the unintended impacts of moving away from plastics to alternative materials having higher energy and material inputs and global warming potentials. Land and marine litter can be stopped by holding the 5 Southeast Asian countries accountable for more than half of the Marine litter. Assist developing countries implement effective collection and waste management systems. In Canada and North America we are the model for the world. The critical issue is all consumers manage all their waste through all 4R's making wise informed choices including the use of this miracle of the 21st Century plastics to keep it out of the environment and as an input into our economy. This is a simple and effective formula for  truly achieving our sustainable development goals and truly protecting the environment and economy.",

Nobody wants to pay $15 for a reusable cup. They might if it only cost $5. \nGrocery retailers could prominently display reusable bins for purchase. I drive to the supermarket and have purchased bins that stay in the trunk of my car. I fill them up with groceries and wheel them out in the shopping cart, pack them into the car and unload at home. They are also great for camping and other carrying purposes. They should be available at all grocers for one-time purchase and actively marketed. No plastic bags!",

So explore the outdoors and nurture nature in your children to become water stewards.  Take a hike along water or try a low-impact water sport while treading lightly on your chosen location.\n\nAs you explore where natural habitats and people intersect, you may also find litter \u2013 which pollute our waterways, entangle wildlife, and is mistaken by wildlife for food.  You can help prevent this by joining a Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup.  Shoreline Cleanups are a tangible means to mitigate pollution, reduce threats to wildlife and ecological health, and reconnect people with nature to help keep our shared waters healthy and sustainable.\"\n\nIt's easy to join a cleanup and you can host your own too! To learn how, visit www.shorelinecleanup.ca. It makes a positive tangible impact too - the data speaks for itself: https:\/\/www.shorelinecleanup.ca\/impact-visualized-data.  \n\n2. Rethink, Refuse, Reuse, Reduce, Repair, Recycle--->Upcycle\n\nRethink our connection with water and waste.  With ~91% of global plastic not being recycled, and with recycling usurping massive resources and energy to recycle, the solutions must be on refusing wasteful packaging etc. to begin with to reduce it, opting for affordable accessible reusable options (or designing and advocating for them if lacking), repairing what can be repaired to avoid sending it to landfills and or waste polluting our waterways, land and beyond... and upcycling what may be considered waste into something new for closed-loop solutions.  In essence, striving towards zero-waste.\n\n3. Vote With Your Wallet.\n\nBy consciously choosing options that go towards zero-waste as much as within one's capacity, one can help push industry, research and development, design, and governance towards zero-waste solutions.\n\n4. Empowering Positive Change\n\n\"Harness your talents and personal connection with water to create positive tangible change in your life, at work, and within civil society, governance, business, and industry to make water sustainability flourish.\" - Aasiya Hussain\n\nThis being said, it must be recognized that this can come with privilege and barriers.  Not everyone may have the capacity to go fully zero-waste, or even fully zero plastic waste. There may be financial, disability, health, logistical, access, or even governance barriers.\n\nSome thoughts on this through another piece by the same author:\n\n\"1. Acceptance, Release, and Resiliency: Much is not in one's control regarding health and disability barriers. What's key is trying one's best from what is within one's capacity, with sincere intentions, and not being hard on yourself with things not in your control. \n\nFor many with health and disability concerns, their lives may depend on medical devices and treatments which due to health and safety require single-use and\/or plastic disposables (as much as we hate plastic disposables), e.g. infusions, catheters, feeding tubes, frequent bloodwork\/injections\/etc., pill bottles, etc. \n\n2. Privilege, Advocacy, Universal Design and Ableism: \n\na) Persons with the privilege of not facing health and disability barriers do not have the right to be \"upset\" with those who do. Many may not even realize their approach may have tinges of ableism (e.g. Campaign slogans like \"Stop Sucking\" can give the impression of telling someone unable to drink at all without a straw to \"Stop Living\". Not the intention, of course, but still ableist.). \n\nFurther, what many may not realize is that not everyone has the privilege of being able to wash, reuse, or even do food prep themselves as barrier-free as those not facing these barriers. They may not have assistance to either. (And some may be facing water scarcity barriers to wash-and-reuse). Yet we can still do so much! (See below).\n\nb) The onus is not on Persons with Disabilities and health barriers to constantly advocate for and defend themselves, rather, the onus is on industry, civil society, and governance to develop affordable zero-waste solutions with accessibility and universal design inherent in product design and decision-making per duty to accommodate. When developing solutions, decision-makers and designers need to realize that an acceptable solution is *not* relegating Persons with Disabilities and Health Concerns to harmful disposable plastics, for they need and deserve plastic-free alternatives as well. With plastics (including foam and some plastic medical devices\/IVs\/etc.) confirmed being made of toxins, carcinogens, and hormone disruptors, we shouldn't be resigned to it as status quo for those with health and disability concerns. Instead, there must be a shift to developing safer, affordable plastic-free zero-waste alternatives with accessibility inherent in their design - and making this available to Persons with Disabilities, Health Concerns, and all.\n\nAlso important to realize when engaging in zero-waste discourse (and product design), is that health concerns and disabilities are diverse and multifaceted - what may work for one, may not for another. Hence the need for inclusive consultation, discourse, design, and decision-making - to develop inclusive accessible barrier-free innovative solutions. \n\nc) Sometimes, necessity and first-hand experience brings innovative solutions. Since we face barriers every day, we reflect on innovative solutions to break through them, voice feedback, etc. It's how inventions and alternatives arise. It's also how Ecohesian Inc. has been releasing accessibility reviews regarding reusable straws and beyond given first-hand experience with health and disability concerns, while also being committed to go zero-waste (http:\/\/bit.ly\/GoZeroWaste). It's also how an Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome patient developed a more user-friendly reusable menses cup with more universal design to address accessibility barriers experienced by herself and others. It's also how several are now developing 3D prostheses made of \"plastic\" waste (amazing!). Many more examples - these are just a few. \n\nIf there's a solution to this waste crisis you may be thinking of, an idea, or dream you'd like to pursue or have implemented or advocate for - go for it! Release the shackles of 'what ifs' and what these limitations mean for reaching one's potential. Seek guidance and collaboration, harness your inner gifts and expertise, and with humility... let this radiate to inspire the world towards positive change. Be it in advocating for inclusive accessible solutions, or in developing an innovative solution based on your authentic lived experience.\n\n3. Rethinking & Repurposing Waste: It's amazing how much we can still do, despite barriers. All it takes is a mindshift. E.g.:\n\na) Valuing One's Contributions (and that of others): What am I already doing that I may not have realized is a powerful means of inspiring zero-waste? E.g. Many with health and disability barriers inherently strive for zero-waste because... it's already hard enough (if not impossible for some) to bring out waste to the curb on waste collection day. How can we leverage this to inspire positive public engagement campaigns inspiring more to reduce waste? Or... take the example that some require the use of handheld (or hands-free) bidets in lieu of toilet paper for accessibility reasons: how can this be a means to inspire others towards these zero-waste options they may not have thought of before?\n\nb) Repurposing Unavoidable Waste: Can unavoidable \"waste\" be upcycled into something new? E.g. \n- Several outdoor schools use sanitized pill bottles to upcycle nature-sound-shakers for their young students and may appreciate donations of these (sanitized) items. \n- Upcycling waste for art therapy, donating it for art installations and projects, etc.\n- Donating unavoidable (sanitized) medical plastic and waste to those upcycling them into 3D printed prostheses.\n- Etc.\n\nThe possibilities are endless. Focus on what you *can* do, and release the guilt of what you don't have control over. You matter, and we're all in this together.\" - Aasiya HussainRead less...",

Those voices are not swayed by pressure from large corporations pushing for fossil fuels or plastic production, but rather those voices come from a place of deep respect for the 7 generations who will follow us and who will live with the consequences of our action or inaction.  Indigenous elders have the knowledge on how to respect our planet, and if that involves uncomfortable government policy, then I think we need to be courageous and finally do what is right.  Too often governments try to balance what is good for the economy and what is good for the environment, and always at a cost to the environment.  The problem of plastic pollution is so widespread that there are little or no bodies of water that are untouched by this, and it is the future generation that will live in a world wrought with health problems and environmental catastrophes.  This requires immediate action and uncomfortable policy decisions.  I truly hope that our government is working with the best interest of the next 7 generations in all the decisions it is about to make about this global and local issue.  Will our government do as so many governments have done in the past, pandering to those with the most economic clout (and those furthest from the consequences of polluted water etc.), or will it be courageous and finally do what is right (right by our future generations)?  I sincerely hope that our government will not make the ''small and easy choices'' that will simply push the problem further down the timeline for another government to deal with, I hope that Canada will be a leader in this area, we are surrounded by water, and we have a responsibility to it.  I thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns with this public consultation!",

Reduction is so important, but it doesn\u2019t deal with what\u2019s out there. Why don\u2019t we go get it?\n\nThe limiting reactant on recycling seems to be the market for post-consumer plastic, but we can expand that market by banning new plastic production and importation. The post-consumer material would have to come from somewhere - it would spur ocean cleanups that could become the basis for a coastal economy or an internal voluntourism trend. Canadians care about this issue and are also eager to be seen helping. Whether that is to spread the movement or for accolades doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 we can harness it into a powerful, ocean saving force!\n\nStymieing the production and importation of NEW plastic would force businesses to consider new options. That could mean plastic reduction but also increases in the use of recycled plastic. Canada could become a world leader in recycling AND drive ocean cleanup projects as a result. It would have positive global impact while creating a healthier Canada to live in, plus some jobs and Greenpeace cred to boot.",

In 1957, the average age to start training was 11 months, and 90 per cent of children were dry during the day by age two. Today, it is not until the age of four that most children are reliably dry. In 2005, one and a half million disposable diapers were sold in Canada!  \n\nI have done it with my child and I only found out about it because I happened to find a book on it in a community book swap. I have told so many of my friends about it and none of them even knew that early potty training was possible. It doesn't have to be extreme, you can still use diapers as a back up, but you offer the child a potty and over time, when you remove their diaper, you find that it is still dry, soon you can see that they don't need them anymore. \n\nThe government should support elimination communication workshops, training and awareness. For example groups like this: http:\/\/godiaperfree.com\/find-a-local-group\/#find-a-group",

Oil kills the environment and everything that needs the environment in time, just like plastic. Plastic in the ocean is nothing compared to what will happen when there is a spill. Moving more oil, will equate to more damage since there is more opportunity. It is like that for everything. More cars on the road=more accidents. More planes in the sky= more accidents. More plastic made=more plastic waste. Its not rocket science. \nCanadians see what our governments priorities and focus is on.  What is even more frustrating is there are plenty of better options, and they are not being chosen. This \"Place Speak\" is likely just that. Waste of time and money, so the politicians look good. Well no one here has said anything surprising or new, or that would take a university education to come up with. I want action, but its all lies as far as I can tell. Politicians have great fake nice faces and voices. This is not where I wanted my money being spent.\nI work in health care. We don't need more money, we need people who are qualified to run it, but that is not what goes on. There is so much waste and mismanagement its sickening. We do not need a pipe line to pay for better health care, we need qualified leadership.",

There are means to recycle plastics. We can do the three, five or nine Rs. It is a function of educating our children early. They need a STEM background and not to be intimidated by science. Plastics are the greatest invention of our lifetime, more revolutionary than the wheel. Do not fear their impact, embrace it. \nWork cooperatively with Industry to improve the circular economy. We don't need to send bales of scrap to Asia to be repurposed. This should be done intelligently at home. There are jobs involved! \nPlease contact CPIA. We are passionate people who have years of wisdom, insight and experience.",

            "comment": "Hopefully some will agree with some of my comments.  I am also interested in others suggestions... \n\nWhat i most important is to clarify the primary large sources and take action on them.  I googled and found a couple of interesting articles from a few years ago that I think are relevant..\n\n*** How much of the \"Plastics\" in the \"Ocean garbage dumps\" is actually intentionally dumped from countries, from freighters, etc.?\n\n1. Specifically for any freighter or ship that transports plastics or garbage for recycle, the ships should be checked prior to leaving and at the destination to ensure that the products gets to destination, and to processing.\n  * https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.org\/encyclopedia\/great-pacific-garbage-patch\/\n  * https:\/\/www.pri.org\/stories\/2016-01-13\/5-countries-dump-more-plastic-oceans-rest-world-combined (is this true?  5 countries at 60%?\n\n2. Recycle and Reuse of plastics into products (such as bricks) should be given major incentives, tax breaks, grants. For example, some countries, I believe, were or are incorporation some of the appropriate items (non-leachable) rfom recycle, etc. into roadbeds of new streets and highways \n\n3. Right now online product\/delivery companies (like Amazon, eBay) are putting millions of boxes and packing materials into the system. What are the alternatives?\n\n4. We need to find  reuses for styrofoam - perhaps with unusable glass into roadbeds, Shred into packing material?.\n\n5. Any boat\/ship\/freighter that dumps needs to have escalating fines to the owner\/company. This includes private boats.  This dumping is a much worse issue than Cambridge Analytica.\n\n6. Public garbage cans all need lids (most do already)\n\n7. WE NEED G7 TO SUPPORT a Y2K APPROACH to this. Remember that those that were doing well with Y2K helped those that were not. We need to help countries (eg. top 5-20 offenders) to just stop the littering and dumping.  This is afffecting our food sources and our health for generations to come....\n\n8. We need to create a business that can actually harvest the ocean dumps - into something. Bill Gates (and now Mark Zuckerberg) would probably help to sponsor YPF2030 (Year Plastics Free 2030)\n\n9. Is there any way to \"combust\" it as a clean power source? with scrubbers?\n\n10. How do we get 100,000 to 1,000,000 people involved in this survey?  Why not ask the University, College and perhaps high school students of Canada to participate as part of their classwork? and ask their parents?  We need to #Innovate \n\n11. We need to build a series of PlaceSpeak consultations on components of the #Plastics issue as part of next steps. Let's make PlaceSpeak a term synomized with Privacy-Protected consultation that we can use again and again.  Get support help from DIACC.ca, IAP2.ca, TELUS, iCompassTech, Foxwise, SAP, etc.  Build on the momentum. This issue will need ongoing support.  \nPersonally, I would like to see this connect up with *** INCONVENIENT TRUTH *** as those involved I expect are also concerened for #Plastic.\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Al_Gore#\/media\/File:Al_Gore,_Vice_President_of_the_United_States,_official_portrait_1994.jpg",

To have a \"plastics ban\" doesn't solve the underlying issue of countries, companies or individuals making the decisions that have lead us to where we are. Plastics evolved over time and are now a major contributor in lowering the usage of non renewable resources (ore, wood) traditionally farmed at a huge environmental cost, let alone the secondary and tertiary producers of these products.  The positives of plastic is that there are options in recycling, repurposing initiatives that are in place, as well as continued R&D on newer, more efficient programs coming to better reduce plastic debris.  We need to remember what plastic has brought to the table when we look at the quality of life we in Canada have.  If we are to ask the government in this issue, it would be to educate people and businesses on recycling, reuse and recovery of plastics, have businesses be accountable for their waste and financially hit when they are not.  Start a national committee responsible for researching viable recycling options such as India has begun to do, (among others) and build roadways from recycled plastics.\nThere are a great many examples of ingenuity when it comes to reduction of waste.  Just to ban anything, straws, pop bottles etc.. doesn't necessarily make the problem go away.  The world needs more options in dealing with plastics and help people have a better understanding of those options.  Get rid of plastics the ocean could be filled with a mountain of metal cans.  Let's be smarter people.",

Packaging has become so complex that local governments handling it is unfeasible. The British Columbia has extended producer responsibility programs, which seem to be working well here. Such agreements should also come with high recycling targets (95%+), a mandate that it is processed within the country and extend everywhere (not just residential). This would help ensure that plastics put out in the market and recycled. If a specific material type is expensive to recycle, it encourages producers to use less packaging or switch to easier to recycle materials. \n\nMarine litter is a sad reality of our profits over people economy. Everyone else brought up great points with I agree with, so I will make some new ones. To start, microfibres (and the textile industry as a whole) are a huge problem. I've heard that it is unfeasible to screen them out at wastewater treatment plants, so another solution would be to mandate that all new washing machines should be outfitted with filters to remove such fibres. Another factor of marine pollution that doesn't get talked about nearly as much as it should be are balloons. Many people release them without even considering the impact that they have once fallen back down (often into waterways). These useless pieces of plastic are often mistaken as food by marine life. High fines for purposely releasing them, or even better, a ban are necessary from stopping this from continually happening.",

That those who eat fish will inevitably be affected by bio accumulation, as so on. I think the fight against micro beads communicated these sorts of arguments effectively...   \n\nThere is also something to be said about the importance of discussing these issues on an international scale.

There have been warning signs about our excessive plastic use for decades, and it is time to take action.\nThere are very few cases where plastic is necessary in an operation. Any reduction is a step in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing until we aren't polluting the places that we live in.\nEven though it is a staggering problem, it is one that needs to be addressed and solved!",

            "comment": "The way you position the issue for this topic on \"Moving Canada towards zero plastic waste\" is greatly skewed to the negatives (please see the \"did you know\" section), and hence you will receive more negative comments than positive ones.  I expect more from my government, and expect a more nuanced view by showing the pros and cons on the topic as there are also many benefits to plastics, otherwise why would they be used so much? Plastics are durable products that help protect our food and beverages, provide safe drinking water to millions of people, lightweight our cars to make them more environmentally friendly and find their way in many medical applications that save lives everyday!\n\nI agree that there is no place for plastics in the ocean and in the environment in general, and as a society we need to do better to eliminate this issue.  But this is not a plastics issue, but a societal issue.  People need to STOP throwing away perfectly good plastic and recycle it, re-use it, re-purpose it. Why are so many European countries able to recycle almost 100% of their plastics and we can't?\n\nPeople also need to realize that the overwhelming majority or plastic waste found in the ocean originates from Asia, where many countries do not have the municipal infrastructure to handle waste.  Maybe that's where we should invest if we really care about eliminating plastics in the ocean. And since plastic is lightweight, one of its many benefits, it floats and it is visible for everyone to see.  But what about all the other waste at the bottom of the ocean? Do we have a double standard where the waste that floats is bad and the one that sinks is perfectly fine?",

            "comment": "As part of a local eco group that works towards the elimination of single use plastics, I believe the only true way to clean up plastics is by governments disallowing\/limiting the creation of these plastics in the first place.  We know that worldwide, 90% of plastics are not being recycled, and even the ones that are have to go through a rigorous process that still is quite polluting.  The time to look at packaging is now.  \n\nOur oceans are a haven for these unrecycled plastics.  There is already a over a tonne of plastic per person in the world floating in our oceans.  Cleaning up the problem is one thing- figuring out what to do with 8 billion tonnes of plastics is another.  If we don\u2019t change this behaviour, we\u2019ll have double that to deal with within 20 years!\n\nIt is time for governments to:\na) put the companies using these plastics on the hook for cleaning them\nb) have stronger municipal incentives to recycle properly\nc) phase out single plastics use altogether\nd) put stricter laws into place with regard to how plastics can be used\ne) be a strong voice in the upcoming UN plastics summit",

As a citizen with no direct ties to these organizations, the blue print outlines basic and a pragmatic approach to tackling Plastic pollution especially around how it impacts our oceans.  In addition, I would also propose that the government work with Industry and create legislature that would create accountability with the Plastic producers in Canada on creating a circular economy regarding the creation of plastic products and how we deal with them in their current form at end of life.  Plastics have become an integral useful product in our society but with over 4,000\/+ types of plastics and blends there needs to be some form of accountability that the plastics that are created can be recycled back into the system there by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.  We add  coloring to plastics, add additives to help extend product life, and create oxo degradeable plastics that are either non recyclable or simply breakdown into Micro plastics that are currently never eliminated from our environment.  The industry needs to be held accountable that any product created has an end of life strategy and can enter back into the work stream as a re-recyclable, re-usable product.  Thank you for allowing me to comment and your consideration.",

I recently watched a documentary on the Nestle bottled water facility in Canada and that they are paying basically nothing to extract the resource from our springs, and sell it to us at a big profit.

First, plastic disposable gloves...if you have ever bought a made-to-order deli sandwich, sub, burger or salad you would know that they use new plastic gloves every time they make a new order. Shouldn't these gloves that are used for food handling be compostable with the nights food waste? Second, the plastic string attaching the clothing to the price tag all which all get thrown out. Maybe the consumer can scan the barcode on their phone, or a store device, for purchase to eliminate these- and also consider each piece of  new clothing shipped in plastic from the supplier. Are there any rules in place to regulate this massive waste. \n\nAlso I think there should be stronger laws about our rights to environmental protections, so our culture isn't taken away from us on political whims.",

Thus, a full on plastic ban is not going to be successful, but what we can start to do is move towards plastic alternatives and make single use plastic items banned. Items like straws, plastic bags, cutlery, plastic wrap, etc. There are alternatives to these such as metal straws, cloth bags, wood cutlery, beeswax paper that can be used instead and would save a lot of trash from going to the ocean and landfill. Am I perfect in using alternative? No and it is something I work on everyday but we need to come together as a country and start making these items unavailable or limited. The grocery store I shop at is plastic bag free, you have to bring a reusable bag. It's such a small action that took some getting use to but is saving so much plastic from entering the landfill. I know carry a reusable bag in my purse\/backpack etc just in case I need to do a stop on my way home and its so easy to do! It's small changes like this that need to become the new norm to helps us REDUCE our plastic use.",

            "comment": "Thinking about the 3 R's - Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle - certain actions are more desirable than others. It is better to reduce plastic waste from the beginning of an item's life cycle than to produce the waste and worry about finding ways to reuse and recycle it. Therefore, strategies should first and foremost focus on plastic reduction. This could include: requirements from producers and manufacturers to make low-packaging and package free goods (switching back to paper and glass packaging, and packaging made from one material), making a plastic-free lifestyle more attainable for all Canadians by educating and informing the public about ways to reduce plastic use in their daily lives (i.e. bring your own reusable water bottle), national-level strategies on 'low-hainging fruit' that would result in big single-use plastic reduction wins such as banning plastic bags at grocery and retail stores, undertaking a campaign to eliminate plastic straw use at restaurants, severely limiting bottled water consumption in areas where potable water is available, and campaigns to encourage reusable drink containers at coffee shops. \n\nSince a large amount of plastic waste already exists, reuse and recycle also have to be taken into account. Public education campaigns on how to reuse items to extend the lifetime of single-use plastic products could be developed. Though many municipalities throughout Canada already have recycling systems in place, recycling should be mandatory for every jurisdiction within the country to ensure waste diversion is maximized. Additionally, funds should be allocated to research and development in the areas of: efficient ways to clean up plastic in the ocean, uses for plastic waste that can't be recycled or is to expensive to recycle (residual plastic waste into a fuel or energy source?)",

I would like to see us reach a point where Canada contributes 0% of the waste found in the world's oceans, but I'd also like to see us take a leadership roll in reducing the global impact. Many of the rivers on the list come from developing nations with few resources to address the problem. I believe that Canada, either through the G7, G20 or United Nations should lead an initiative to raise funds and lend expertise to help address this problem at the source. Ideally this could help to significantly reduce ocean pollution and create jobs in the developing world.",

Toothpaste, deodorant, face, hand, body cream, shampoos and conditioners, toothbrushes, hair bushes, combs, blowers.  It is everywhere.  I wanted to share video of debris from a fish feedlot off the shores of Nova Scotia.  Every storm at least one of these sites is broken apart.  Fish escape, the sites are made of plastic piping filled with styrofoam and the buoys they use are also filled with styrofoam that ends up in the ocean and on land where birds nest, some are endangered species or species at risk.  These cages need to be removed from our oceans.  Why anyone would allow them to be in an environment where they are going to be torn apart in every storm, (and the storms are becoming more frequent and more violent), is being absolutely derelict in their duty to protect our wild fish.  Get them out of our oceans! https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zaysh-YnF3g",

The perfect example is the trend to ban plastic straws: they are a negligible amount of plastic waste (compared to the plastic bottles, coffee cup lids, stir sticks, etc) and many people with disabilities require them. A quick Google will tell you that for some people, a bendy single-serve plastic straw is the best way to hydrate. Focus on the real problems (fishing gear is half the ocean waste; manufacturers continue to make wasteful packaging and the environment pays the cost) and ensure you have diverse voices advising you!",

So much plastic waste occurs behind the scenes in industry (retail\/manufacturing\/business etc.). Zara, for example, brings each new item of clothing to the retail store in a plastic bag, tears it open to put it on the shelf, and sells it in another plastic bag. Even if this is recycled, this is such unnecessary waste, and will require vastly different solutions to the problems of litter or packaging of groceries, as consumers have no control over these types of business decisions (and often do not know about them). Companies may overuse plastic for the sake of convenience and driving down costs - this is not something they are likely to abandon, especially when the public cannot see it. Truly reducing Canada's plastic waste will involve huge solutions and possibly forcing businesses to comply.",

Shipping our plastic waste to Asia and elsewhere for processing is not acceptable behavior! Canada needs to lead the way in creating a \"circular economy\" for plastic based packaging.",

If more single-use plastics had deposits on them, more would be returned (looking at the Beer Store model).

            "comment": "My biggest concern in the entire plastics discussion, is that many decisions (such as outright plastic bans) are being generated from uneducated opinion, or a subset of the facts.  The only proper solutions will be generated from a holistic view of the use of plastics.  The reality is that plastics offer so much value in the right applications, making our lives easier, safer and healthier in ways we aren't always fully aware of.  Whether providing much-improved food protection (minimizing food waste), generating lower environmental impact in their production relative to plastic substitutes, or contributing to other environmental benefits in their usage (such as through light-weighting of materials reducing transportation costs\/emissions), through to so many other benefits in our lives, plastics are here for a reason.  Any ban or reactive legislation, without understanding the full picture, risks creating unintended consequences.  \n\nThere are valid study results showing that replacing plastics with substitute materials would result in roughly a 4 times increase in environmental impact.  Imagine a reflexive decision targeted at plastic elimination (for the purpose of waste reduction) inadvertently increasing GHG emissions and negatively impacting another of our environmental focus areas.  Personally, I want ot have my cake and eat it too.  I do want to minimize waste, AND I want to reduce our broader environmental footprint.  The waste piece can largely be addressed through improvements in human behavior (targeted at what WE do with our plastic materials after using them) and improved access to recycle value streams, most of which already exist, yet aren't accessible everywhere.  \n\nMy vision is a world with INCREASED plastic usage (must be a recyclable material) in order to reduce the overall environmental footprint, AND significantly improved access to recycle facilities to manage the waste stream (or waste-to-energy facilities), in concert with improvements in OUR behaviours, globally.  \n\nPlease look at the whole picture.  I'm speaking as a citizen, a Chemical Engineer, and an industry person.  The answers may seem complex, but only need the right balanced guidance to find true solutions, not band-aids that merely shift the problems.  Even single-use plastics provide real value, and likely are all recyclable if we simply choose to do so...",

Even is spoiled by food, it can biodegrade in the garage;\n- Most recyclable plastic containers are for us to feel better but are hard to reuse since not a lot of applications.\nIn conclusion, the Government needs to legislate hard ASAP since industry will never take a leadership role since they are not paying for the waste.",

I truly hope that the government will work on policies that will make Canada a leader in reducing plastic waste, and that the government will not be afraid to take a hard stance against plastic waste, even if it risks the wrath of some parts of industry and the public.  \nTo me, the most important thing is to reduce plastic creation and consumption.  Making recycling programs more efficient is definitely also important, however I think the focus should be on making plastic less prevalent in Canadian's lives.  I would 100% support a fee for plastic bags and other kinds of plastic packaging charged at stores (and I am a \"starving student\" currently, with very limited disposable income). I also hope that other single-use plastic items are banned, or at least that the issues related to them are more heavily publicized (i.e. such as single-use cutlery, dishes, decorations, etc.)  Along this line, I hope that alternatives to these single-use items are promoted more heavily (i.e. metal drinking straws).",

There should be much stricter laws when it comes to consumer packaging. Ban companies from important\/exporting if they can't comply to environmental standards (that should be implemented). For example, there is so much unnecessary plastic when buying beauty products, toys, etc. During festivals and events, plastic cups should outright be banned. In Germany, during many events, you pay a deposit, get a reusable cup (whether it be a beer mug or cup) and if you return it, you get your deposit back or you can keep the cup for future use. This has been at least since 2006. Canada is so far behind.  Force chains like Tim Horton's and Second cup to use reusable coffee mugs. The amount of Tim Horton's cups littering our beautiful country is shameful. Reduce, reuse then recycle- this is something lacking in Canada.",

The plastics industry made it and they take it back.\n\nSame goes for any and all human made products.\n\nFor the last 50 years and presently,  Canadian governments serve the plastics industry to distort the MANDATE to not serve the people and not protect the environment. Face it. Own it. The first risk of governance is distortion of MANDATES by political party funders with vested interest and bias. This is one of them. \n\nIf this was not true, then we would not be having this incessant conversation of what to do, going on now for 50 years to still not have a reasonable solution, as we and the rest of the living world, drown in plastic litter and every other human made litter.\n\nThis is similar to the tobacco industry denying that smoking causes cancer.  Now what is the problem with plastic litter in the environment? After all, we have governments on our side that have done nothing to little to stop the littering as we profit....a brownfield by any other name for the people to pay for the clean-up of decades of neglect. \n\nThe simple answer is and always has been and will be a regulated cradle-to-grave economy where every human made consumer product has a life cycle of manufacturing, maintaining and re-processing to use, re-use, recycle, just like in nature. \n\nTherefore, if the plastics industry made the product, then the plastics industry is responsible for manufacturing, maintaining and re-processing such that there is no litter, anywhere. Just like nature: there no such thing as litter, garbage, waste, but another economic opportunity.\n\nIt's time to get off the plastic picket fence and force the plastics industry in Canada and world-wide to clean up its plastic mess on land, air and sea, just like an oil spill and\/or be charged\/ fined to extract money for the clean-up.\n\nSome good  jobs are on the way to help kick-start the cradle-to-grave economy to protect the environment for people and all other living entities on the planet.\n\nAnything else? Yes. Advise the Prime Minister that any political donations from the plastics industry to any politician\/ political party is considered a conflict of interest by the ONE taxpayer, me, to stop it.\n\nEnough hypocrisy.",

            "comment": "One of the biggest issues about marine litter is the amount of plastic that is already in our oceans. Even if we reduce the amount of plastic used and getting into our waterways, there is still tons of it already in the ocean! I'm particularly worried that these microplastics will get into the food chain, as research has shown that it's already happening. In addition, these plastics adsorb lots of chemicals, which will also get transferred into the food chain and some may even biomagnify, which is dangerous for top predators (and humans, who tend to be at the top of a lot of food chains). We need to do something not only to reduce plastic consumption, but also to help clean up the oceans.",
