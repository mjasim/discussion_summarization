We truly appreciate all the assistance.\n\nI want to clarify a few things. She lives alone so there are many coworkers and friends trying to help, myself included. I'm a former coworker and I now live on the other side of the country. \n\n**The Facebook group can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/findmaryannclark) and the Union Township Police Department posted about her at [this link](https://www.facebook.com/unionpolicenj/posts/1551757268236724).** There are numerous people taking on different tasks -- I'll post the latest updates as I have them, and I will also be able to share any new details with the rest of the search party. We definitely did not create a fake post or a fake story for Reddit karma...\n\nAnswers to other questions that were asked:\n\n* No record of her at NY or NJ hospitals. I've personally made calls and we've had police contacts check for us as well. We also asked about Jane Doe patients.\n\n* There is ongoing communication with law enforcement in NY and NJ. People are going through the procedures necessary to get authorization for law enforcement to check financial activity, transit surveillance footage, etc. \n\n* Other search party members have gone to all the transit stations along her route in NJ and NY, spoken to Port Authority police, MTA, etc. and handed out flyers.\n\n* Her cell phone is off and has had no activity. \n\n* She doesn't have a car.\n\n\nMany users have complained about my post title requesting upvotes. I've also gotten some derogatory comments and \"bad wishes,\" but the mods and other users have been really great about combatting those. Thank you to them and my apologies for unintentionally breaking a Reddit rule.\n\nSome people have suggested this is an elaborate plan to \"stalk\" or endanger Mary Ann. Obviously that is outrageous and not true, but I understand why it can be challenging to parse out the truth on the internet. The \"missing person\" flyer explicitly provides a contact number for her local police department. I posted on Reddit because I thought that maybe a handful of commuters would come across the flyer and even one small clue or new piece of information could be a major development. Fortunately many people have seen the post, so we're keeping our fingers crossed. \n\nIf the mods or admins need to contact me privately because of some Reddit rule issues or other kind of verification, I understand and that's no problem.",

We know she takes the 5:18AM train from Union Station, and she was wearing the same purple coat, only carrying her purse. So the assumption is she was heading to work Friday morning. Her building is a key card building, and there has been no reentry since she left Friday. People have banged on her door throughout the day just in case. \n\nWe canvassed the surrounding area (Her building is literally right next to the Union Train Station), stopping in local businesses. We also stopped by Union Fire Dept, Hillside Fire Dept, Overlook Med Center, Kean University, and Newark Penn Station. All area hospitals have been called repeatedly checking both Mary Ann's name and Jane Doe to no avail. \n\nAs of yesterday evening, the Police had told us that a detective would not start working on the case until after the holiday weekend. Without them, we are unable to access phone and financial records to see if they hold any clues. \n\nI understand some concern's here about stalking or nefarious efforts, but please note, we are not asking you to contact anyone but the police should you have information. She was a beloved office manager and we are all banding together to try and find her. \n\nThank you,\n\nhttp://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2018/01/74-year-old_woman_went_missing_after_work_police_s.html",

We've contacted them about the Friday morning update.\n\n* See /u/stzinn88 's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/7q7u39/please_upvote_trying_to_locate_a_missing_person/dso2jx6/)\n\n* Again, for all the people who are worried about this being a hoax or something nefarious, all of the posts and flyers have provided the **Union Police Department phone number 908-851-5000** right from the beginning. My understanding is that there is now a detective assigned to the case (a couple of days earlier than expected). \n\n* We (the search team) know the next step would be to go through the surveillance footage from the various transit stations along her commute. Unfortunately that's not something that can be done without law enforcement/legal assistance, so at the moment we are waiting on the police for that process to begin. We currently don't have answers to questions about which stations she may or may not have been seen at, confirmation of which trains she may have gotten on, etc. As soon as footage is reviewed, there will be some more answers.\n",

                "CMNT_BODY": "Here is my two cents as a former retail manager and someone who has lived in a few different 'markets' ranging from backwater God's country to hustle n' bustle metropolis.\n\nRent is definitely a huge factor -- see shopping malls. My old RadioShack cost about $14K a month base in rent back in 2005 anchored next to a Sears. This of course didn't even account for other occupancy expenses, security, waste removal, etc. Bear in mind, being next to a Sears is often considered 'the budget friendly' side of the mall, if we were anchored to a more desirable store or in the center of the mall, then that rent easily doubles (or triples).\n\nOnline retailers hurt for many reasons -- some obvious, some not so much. The obvious is of course customers can shop from the comfort of their couch, in pajamas, without retail jargon and smoke-and-mirror sales pitches. Retailers did this to themselves - they didn't get hip to the jive of the future until it was way too late. As for the less obvious reasons: \n\n* Customers are more educated now (or at the very least - have quick access to the information they need).\n\n* No reason for 'loyalty' to any particular retailer -- The prices are the same everywhere now, the coupon restrictions are the same everywhere. The only reason to be loyal to a retailer is if they offer exceptional service - but that is tough because...\n\n* Retail employment is not a viable career choice for people with any respect for their time and quality of life. I heard about a mythical time in retail management in the 80s/90s/00s where retail managers were clearing well into six figures, fat bonuses, exotic perks, and life was pretty good. However, that all seemed to come crashing down around the time I got into retail ('05-'10). Retailers prey on young professionals or lifers and demand 50-60 hour work weeks on a salary that seems good on the surface until you figure out the actual hourly wage. As for the non-manager employee -- minimum wage. You can't retain specialized talent or people that give a damn for the long-term with these conditions. Which leads to:\n\n* The average shopping experience in retail sucks. Save for a few exceptions - most retailers are the same experience: Walk into a store, grossly understaffed, the people there range from useless to friendly - but seldom helpful, the prices aren't competitive, the selection is suspect, and the checkout process is a minefield. On top of that, the employees generally have too many assigned tasks to spend more than fifteen seconds with a customer. I wonder why?\n\n* The C-level at most of these companies is very incestuous. Unfortunately I can't cite any sources at the moment, but many companies generally cannibalize within the industry. That failing company that just went bankrupt last year? Yeah that CXO is probably in a similar position in another company. Rinse, lather, repeat. \n\nThere is a lot more to it than this, but I feel it portrays the current retail landscape. I don't know if it can (or should) be fixed, but I think the current model isn't sustainable. \n",

It seems a large part of this stems from land-use and zoning regulations. Moretti and Hseih write well about this issue: https://eml.berkeley.edu//~moretti/growth.pdf. While this usually addresses residential housing, I would argue this impacts rents in general since housing development in general is stymied. \n\nI look at aspiring restaurateurs and don't see how they can succeed in NYC, unless they have deep-pocketed investors or are already rich and/or famous. This mirrors the general change in the city; it used to be that people came to NYC to try and make it; now it is people who have already have it made who come. Living in NYC is just another notch in their belt of status. I call them Insta-Yorkers. My father started by delivering meat from the meat-packing district, when they actually still did that. Opened his first restaurant in the 80's and became pretty successful. He was a hard, stubborn, tough man; which in hindsight, was probably necessary to his survival back then. More than a few times he took care of business with his fists. I cannot really see him succeeding in the current climate. \n\nI used to be that in Washington Square Park you had a very good mix of people and you would have kids of all ages and backgrounds playing. Now it is just tourists, NYU kids, and babies, literally. They removed the hills and anything else slightly older kids could play on. I met all my best childhood friends in that park and none of them were white or wealthy. Just saying. It seems we have really taken several steps back. I had thought I was a progressive; but I don't recognize alot of these \"New Yorkers\" who talk about their progressive values. They value diversity, but like the Brooklyn Heights parents balk at integration if it involves their kids. We tacitly accept the most-segregated school system in the country. We abuse land-use regulations to prevent housing development; now we are pretty hopelessly behind in housing supply. Which leads to these silos of high performing schools open pretty much only to those who could afford these rents. We are fine taking the mortgage interest deduction and 529 college plans even if they are regressive. I see a lot of talking and no walking from progressives. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Landlords are willing to wait to get a good tenant instead of jumping the gun to \"fill the space.\"  It should be no surprise that landlords do what is in their best interest - and sometimes waiting is in their best interest.\n\n- 2008 was recession.  A lot of businesses went out of business and new tenants moved in at cheaper than normal terms.  2018 - 10 years later - these leases are ending.  It's a new environment.  \n\n- Some stores are here for branding and exposure.  They will not make any direct profit for their corporations.

There are so many things that retailers/brands do wrong & one thing I can say about most of their marketing & social media staff (whom seem to get treated far better than the staff actually doing the work) is how embarrassingly computer illiterate they all are.  This is both young and old marketers at very very large companies.  Even today there is this \"oh that's for the computer people\" mentality.  I don't expect them to know the inner workings of AI, programming & computer engineering (that's my job). Yet, to see people who are making 6 figures & whom are probably off until the second week of January while the rest of the real staff misses out from family events these next few days, not know basic computer/email & social media concepts by now... is a sight to behold.  I'm not talking about dinosaur execs who have AOL emails & ask for faxes(that too is a major issue holding back not just retail but many large companies)...there's 20-something marketing \"gurus\" for big big brands, marketing & financial firms whom have to be told how the internet & email works at times.

                "CMNT_BODY": "I think it was a seemingly gradual shift (though actually break-neck speed in hindsight) in consumer expectations. Prior to internet shopping, going to a store and performing a special order was common place. Hell, ordering directly from a catalog or TV-network was common too.\n\nHowever - Amazon, eBay, and other eTailers started offering perks that made shopping online a pleasure. You could do instant comparison between several storefronts, research product information, save yourself the cost of sales tax, and get the item for a significantly cheaper base cost. This has leveled off a bit in recent years but there was a time ordering online often meant saving 10-30% off the top (not even including the tax savings).\n\nIt started off with younger generations first, but even the older generations caught on and hopped on board too. Unfortunately this really, in my opinion, hit small businesses the hardest. Large corporations have the bank and footprint to evolve and survive (though they're obviously not immune). Small businesses can't hang unless they're lucky or have a service-based business. Selling tangible goods is almost always a losing battle these days due to the competition and manufacturing policies.\n\nExamples of these practices are MAP (Minimum Advertised Pricing) and forced buy-in quantities. That is to say, if your business agrees to carry 'Brand X' then you CANNOT advertise their products lower than Y price. If you do, then the manufacturer can pull their partnership with you. This is why you see most retailers offering the same price points on their products. As for buy-ins, it is prohibitively expensive and often times impossible for small business to keep up - they simply don't have the capital. For example, my local music shop can no longer carry Fender or Gibson products because the minimum buy-in per year ranges between $50K-$250K. These brands do NOT care about your sell-thru. So if you buy $50K of equipment but only sell $35K? Tough cookies, $50K is your minimum order next year. Oh yeah, by the way, the vendor may not offer you another line of credit to buy more equipment since you have a balance. Oh yeah, also, the payment terms are now NET-0 (meaning you must pay in full for the product received at time of purchase). You can see how this becomes unsustainable for a family owned business.\n\n**tldr:** Sorry for derailing a bit, but to answer you question directly - I think internet sales hit brick and mortar businesses hard and fast. I think we're still in an adjusting period that will require drastic changes to normalize (if even possible). ",

I kept two ground floor storefronts empty for two years rather than budge on price. (I wasn't charging crazy rent like Manhattan landlords though.) Anyway my reasoning was that I am trying to improve the quality of tenants, which will lead to increase in quality and price overall, and tenants on the ground floor set the tone for the entire building. Tenants are lot more likely to pay higher rent for a building with a popular coffee shop or a bank on the ground floor. It leads to a lot more attention, exposure, and foot traffic for other tenants also. I wasn't losing money as I received rents from other tenants enough to offset expenses, so I didn't feel the immediate need to fill the space. Sure, I was missing out on thousands of dollars a month, but once I gave it to a subpar tenant (in my eyes) they would be able to stay for five years, and that's five years I am stuck with the tenant and I would not be able to improve the building the way I want to. I didn't expect to wait as long as I did, but at the end I am happy that I waited. One of the storefronts was filled by a coffee shop chain and they spent a lot of money renovating the space. The value of the building has gone up quite a bit.\n\nNow would I have left it empty for five years, ten years? Probably not. But I also wouldn't charge rent that not even a bank could pay either... so not a perfect explanation as to why they do what they do, but I hope it at least shed *some* light on landlord's perspective...",

Very little is held in cash, and the lenders must be placated to keep them from calling your loans. \n\nI'll give you an outline of why this is the case. Let's say you're a property \"investor.\" Congrats! Now, you have some properties, you started small - now most property and wealth is inherited, but we'll pretend that's not the case. So you bought a small property, and after a few years you leverage that to buy another. Continue this down the line, and you have 20 to 30 properties, all bought on spec. Since you're small, you're probably lending from multiple banks and sources. Chances are you're not paying prime plus one, but a bit more. No matter, you're making enough in rent off the old properties to subsidize the new ones. You're property rich, and cash-flow rich, but as for actual money, you're right on the edge.\n\nNow, you want to get into where the real money is made, and the real gains accrue, luxury real estate and commercial property in main cities. So you get a loan to buy a storefront, say three stories, two of prime commercial and one of residential on the top. All are luxury, all demand high prices. But you don't have the cash to purchase it, so you put your other properties up (which are already leveraged) against a loan for this one.\n\nNow, you *have* to show your lenders that you're cashflow positive, or else they'll start to worry about your ability to pay them back. If you rent it out at $95 a square foot, you'll break even. With upkeep costs, lost tenants, taxes (which are minimal, really), and other unforeseen issues, you're probably not making money. And your lenders know this. They need you to make enough money to cover your costs and to provide them with their money. If they don't think you can do this, they'll call your loan and either seize the property or force a sale to recoup their costs.\n\nSo what do you do if the lender is breathing down your neck? Well, they don't particularly care if it's empty for a short period, that's the cost of doing business. But they don't want you to get locked in a 20 year commercial lease that will be below market rate, and below their aggregate rate of return. So you, as the building owner, let it sit until someone will pay your the rent you want, to protect yourself from squirrely investors.\n\nAnd that's one reason why rents go up. Because the nature of the real estate market is distinctly speculative, and almost all done with borrowed money. ",

                "CMNT_BODY": "I can explain.  Building owners don't set the price or rent it out.  They hire property managers, and usually the same property manager will manage a dozen or more buildings for different owners.\n\nProperty managers are paid a commission for tenants usually an upfront fee plus monthly, but they have no costs like property tax or upkeep, which are handled by the building owner.  This means that a vacant unit is $0 for a property manager while it's -$2,000/mo (negative) for an owner.\n\nAlso, a newly rented unit at $5,000/mo is only $3,000/mo profit for the owner, but the property manager receives 10% of that, plus 50% of the broker fees.  Broker fees are usually 1 month's rent. So the property manager makes $2,500 upfront plus $500/mo.  That huge upfront payday for a new tenant more than makes up for months of vacancy.  So it's worth it to fish for $7,000 instead of $5,000 if it means getting $3,500 upfront and $700/mo.  If you do the math, even with almost 7 months vacancy it's better. (2500 + 500 x (12+m) = 3500 + 700 x 12 => m=6.8).  And that's not including the effect that higher rents on one building makes it easier to move the market and get high rents on the other 11 buildings the property manager controls.  This game keeps going until the owner fires the property manager, but there are very few property managers and they all play the same game.\n\nTl;dr: owners aren't the same as the managers; if you do the math, it's more profitable for managers to keep them vacant and fish for a payday\n",

I doubt there are any places where, even if you offered the space for free, you couldn't get *anyone* to move in. The point is to make it make more financial sense to find somebody to fill that space rather than leave it vacant. And often those vacant storefronts are a major factor contributing to making an area undesirable. Filling more of those storefronts raises the desirability of everything around it, and can be one way for those neighborhoods to recover.\n\nAnd you could always have some programs or tax exemptions to help those lower-income areas. For example, you could have something that provides property tax reductions for owners who have to drop their rents low enough in order to find a tenant that their rent revenue doesn't cover their property tax. That's all just minutia of the implementation. But overall, a vacancy tax is an excellent idea.

EVERY SINGLE DAY.\n\nLet's go a little further - how many bagels is this? \nI'm going to hazard a guess at around \u00a35 per bagel.\n\u00a32,222.22 / \u00a35 = 444.4 round down to 444 bagels per day. \n\nMost of these sales will be over the lunch period say 12 noon to 13:30ish where 90% of bagel sales are probably condensed.\n\n400 bagels served in 90 minutes. Seems unlikely especially as it takes a Subway a few minutes to make my sub here in the uk. Seems even more improbable with it being a small independent business. Certainly not something a one of two man crew would be able to do in a tiny deli, even with good footfall.I\n\nThe UK has its problems in every town and city and it is for the exact same reason that banks and owners don't want to mark down commercial property and devalue their assets.",

I think that retail property owners have an obligation to rent their space. Otherwise, everyone in the area loses out on having goods or services available for access at that space. So, a good solution might involve some sort of property tax with an exponentially increasing tax rate that keeps on rising for as long as a space remains unoccupied. Plus, some sort of minimum time period that a property must have an active tennant before the tax rate jumps back to the highest level before the most recent tenant. \n\nFor example, a landlord might rent the space to a Pop-Up Shop, just to get the tax rate to reinitialize to the lowest rate. The regulations need to accommodate the reality that some stores will close naturally. So, when a property remains vacant for more than a minimum number of months, only then would the regs require jumping back to the highest tax rate over the past five years, or something like that.\n\nMy point here ties to the reality that cities have some control over these kind of squatter behaviors by landlords with so much wealth that they have contempt for the citizens deprived of active storefronts.",

I live on the upper west side which I admit, is an expensive area. But I was walking around doing some last minute shopping yesterday and I hit a couple of the little shops on Columbus just to see what they had. They have the same faux fur hats you can get in a department store for $20, only they throw their tag on it and charge $80. It's not an improvement in quality or a luxury brand or especially fashionable. It's nothing, just four times the price because they think people will pay it. And while some might, I was in the shop for about 30 minutes, mid afternoon two days before Christmas and I think I saw one person check out while a few dozen walked in and left. Wealthy people will buy expensive stuff, sure, but they're not gonna give away their money for crap just because. Tourists might, but I would think people that live here would be a little smarter. \n\nSimilar experience with a cocktail bar we went to in the same area last night. $18 cocktails and the place is 3/4 empty on a Friday night. My gf asked them to make one small change to a drink, just leave a garnish she doesn't like out. The bartender looked at her like she just spit in his face and told her \"they can't change any of the drinks because it will ruin the experience...maybe she should just pick something else\". $18 for a vodka cocktail, goddamit you should be making it exactly how I like it with a fucking smile. You're a brand new place, it's not like you have a Michelin Star, drop the pompous asshole attitude. Needless to say, we'll never be back and now I know why they were empty while bars around them were cranking.\n\nI've been in and around NYC my whole life and it's always been expensive, but it just seems like everyone is starting to get overwhelmingly greedy in every sector.

For those who couldn\u2019t afford a home in 2016, they never came within reach.*\n\n3. *The tax had \u201czero impact\u201d on affordability, said Elton Ash, regional executive vice-president at RE/MAX of Western Canada.*\n\n4. *Prices were back on the rise in the spring, with the condo market, in particular, heating up. The benchmark price of an apartment in Greater Vancouver now stands at $600,700, a whopping 17.6 per cent above year-ago levels. Domestic homebuyers appear to have given up on trying to purchase a detached house (benchmark price: $1,587,900) and are now piling into the condo market, said Reitzes.*\n\n-\n\nMore reading [here.](http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/why-the-foreign-buyers-tax-isnt-making-vancouver-more-affordable/)\n\n*Vancouver\u2019s low number of listings in the resale market, the types of homes being built, and a very low rental vacancy rate\u2014clocking in at less than 1 per cent\u2014are all playing a role. But it\u2019s the lack of adequate supply, not the intervention of foreign buyers, that remains the biggest factor at play in Vancouver.*\n\n-\n\n*Any drop-off in demand from foreign investors, perhaps discouraged by the tax, appears to have been filled by domestic buyers. Vancouver has enjoyed strong growth in population, wages and job creation, all of which support house price growth. Town homes and apartments, which typically sell for less than single-detached homes, are in high demand for first-time buyers and families. This leads to multiple-offer situations and increasing prices. The number of homes under construction in Vancouver is at record levels, but is struggling to keep up to the demand. Vast parcels of land\u2014currently zoned for industrial and agricultural use\u2014aren\u2019t available for housing.*\n\n-\n\nWhere have you head this problem before?

Think about this problem stretched over 25 years.\n\nTo the lessor, the security of fixed rent payments is offset by well... higher monthly payments than might  be otherwise implied.  The owner of the asset (property owner) needs to be compensated for duration risk, so they seek the highest and best customer available. \n\nSo yeah, that's the economic theory as to why that might happen.",

We distribute our Bird Seed X to stores twice a month. We'll send 4 per delivery.' Now, they do this to minimize product sitting idle on a shelf. If sell-thru stays constant or quick, then the average on-hand may increase incrementally over time. \n\nThis type of system doesn't always handle surges well. For example, what happens if a bird rescue organization comes in and buys all of the bird seed in the store on one order? Some systems may interpret this as a trend and start overloading the store with bird seed. Conversely, if you're the only person in the area that buys that bird seed, then the store may order it rarely. There is more to it than this but it is the gist.\n\nAmazon will always trump Petsmart in on-hand quantities because Petsmart has to maintain 1,500 stores and take their best guess at inventory levels. Amazon only has to worry about stocking distribution centers and will deliver directly to the customer as needed.\n\nDoesn't excuse Petsmart for not being 'smarter' about their inventory management, but its a fundamental problem that is more difficult to solve for after a cursory glance.\n\n",

I worked for a little doing mortgage brokering for an investor and messed with this quite a bit. \n\nWhen a building owner is going to refinance a property, or to sell a property to someone who is getting financing, they have to get rent rolls and financial information on all commercial tenants. Pretty in depth info, too. If your commercial tenant a year into a 10 year lease, they want to make sure you can pay that money for the remaining 9 years. Depending on the lender, they can get pretty crazy about it and want all sorts of info on the financial health of the commercial tenant. Taxes, earnings statements, etc. to ensure the tenant can pay, which determines whether you can pay the mortgage on the building. \n\nHands down, chain retail tenants look much better, are easier to verify, and look better to lenders, which is better for landlords. \n\nThis has further reaching pieces, as it also is part of the death of \u201clocal\u201d or \u201ccommunity\u201d banks that you\u2019ve had relationships with for years. You\u2019ve gotta prove income streams and financial security to some faceless person you\u2019ve never dealt with that\u2019s looking at tons of loans. \n\nThe system is shitty, but it\u2019s the system that exists now.

For that the rent just has to be low enough.\n\nIf stores are vacant in Manhattan then it is **necessarily** not due to a lack of foot traffic. You could make the case that in parts of Cleveland, there aren't enough customers to keep the lights on even with a rent of $0 because of minimum wage laws, insurance, and that sort of thing, but that absolutely isn't the case here.",

Classical economics would say that the landlords would be trying to maximize the present value of the rents they receive from their properties over some time frame, likely the life of the landlord.

The wealth of the landlord would only really be relevant in determining the discount rate of future cash flows as a result of short term cash flow needs of less wealthy landlords.  \n\nSo if a landlord is trying to maximize the present value of the rents they receive, government intervention that prevents evicting tenants or has restrictions regarding rent increases would be very relevant.  If you can only raise rent X% per year it is really important to start at as high an initial rent as possible.  So it could very well be possible that leaving a storefront empty for a period of time in order to hold out for a higher starting rent makes sense, in the classical economic sense.  \n\nBy the way, there aren't any political conservative/liberal normative statements in that argument.",

There's still a few places you can find $4-5 beers. \n\nAlso, the higher COL is totally worth it if you live within healthy spending ratios. I've lived in both lower COL areas and NYC and I feel like NYC was such a smarter move from a financial perspective  - you can just pay off debt and accumulate wealth so much faster if you're earning more. I was making $60k and paying $650 a month for rent in NJ, but I felt like I was only able scratch at my student loans and 15% of $60k in a 401k isn't great. I moved to NYC and made $120k a year out the door for doing the same exact thing. Rent went up to $1800 a month but I have around $2000 additional disposable income at the end of the month. Which went right at my student loans, so I was able to get those paid off in two years. I might have to pay for a $20 hamburger sometimes, but I'm easily putting $25k a year in savings/retirement because I manage my budget from a percentage perspective. \n\nAlso, you have to keep in mind that while some things are more expensive, a lot of things are cheaper or stay the same price. My cell phone, utilities and groceries are relatively the same as they were in NJ. I don't have to pay for a car, gas, or insurance. At the end of the day, NYC makes sense if you actually calculate out the the cost of living here and determine the salary you need. The problem comes when people from other parts of the country who make $40k accept a job in NYC making $60k because they think that's a good raise. It's not - it's a pay decrease. ",

I've seen this happen most when the landlord owns multiple properties. When they price out a successful business the property just sits there because they don't want to lower the rent.

It didn't and instead created a loophole.\n\nI know you said \"There is no such thing as a loophole.\"  but of course there is. The definition of a loophole is \"an ambiguity or inadequacy in the law or a set of rules.\" IE: \"they exploited tax loopholes\". That's exactly what Helen Rosenthal's people explained to us- the law allows this deduction because the laws are lax and there is a loophole the Landlords are using.\n\nFinally, the people at her office *were* specific as I stated above, they cited the actual laws & loophole to the laws. They were very familiar with this problem and were well versed in it. I didn't think write down the laws as they came out in a larger discussion about the neighborhood.

I'm sure there is always some sort of a demand for city centre property.

For example apartment building can have 100+ units... only a few malls in the northeast have 100+ units. It's very uncommon in the city. We're also really not talking about office space as much but storefronts.\n\nThe city approves building permits and does zoning. One of the considerations is demand. The city could approve an office or a condo with a dozen units or a large apartment building with hundreds. Or a mall. They have a lot of reasons for what they want to zone for and what they will approve, and obviously developers have \"input\" ($$$)... but the city controls supply by zoning and approving projects that meet the needs of the city. They do it slow enough to not tank property values, but hopefully fast enough to keep rents affordable relative to income (residential or commercial)... that's the goal at least.\n\nNow what's going on is the city zones and approves construction, but the supply doesn't really hit the market in terms of satisfying the demand. It's a financial product. People buy it not to occupy or lease out (thereby reducing demand) but to hold as a security product. The people hunting for storefronts or homes don't see most of this new supply. As a result the demand stays high and grows unchecked.\n\nThe reason why commercial is in more of a crisis than residential, and the reason why I think residential will follow is just volume. There might be 1 commercial unit per 10 residential units... Because we're talking about smaller numbers 100 units less in the commercial space is much more impactful than in the residential space.  However at the rate things are changing, residential I think will eventually hit that threshold.",

We're talking about the problem of having investors using real estate as investments, messing up the city's ability to function and fill both people's and business's needs.  \n  \nIf all the real estate was just owned by local landlords (how I imagine it was in 1800, 1850, 1900, 1960), then those landlords would rent it for the best rates they could get. If any one type of zoning (residential, office, storefront etc) got too pricey, the city might either build or rezone for more of it to fill the need. BUT now the city cannot control what is actually hitting the market, because when they zone/allow construction, a meaningful percentage of it is bought/held by investors who are not interested in the city's goals, and are able to weather the cost of keeping it off the market, in order to hold out for a higher price. Which is the thesis of this post. You are pointing out that this is happening in residential too, and predicting that whatever negative outcome befalls storefronts, will happen to residential too.  \n  \nThanks for the dialogue!",

He was \u201cin bed\u201d with the Orthodox Jews, allowing them to police themselves. Many charges were dropped so that the *community* could handle the matters internally. In exchange, the community always voted for Hynes. \n\nMany of the allegations were sexual abuse cases between Rabbis and young boys. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not a conspiracy nut but the reality is, there is a sexual abuse epidemic in that community on par with that of the church. The sweetheart deal that Hynes struck with the group ensured that the stories never made the papers - while the church was hung out to dry. \n\nI should also note that there is a significantly under reported amount of domestic abuse in there communities. Again, the *real* charges are dropped so that the husband and wife could hash things out in front of a rabbinical council. \n\nInternally, Kenneth Thompson told his ADAs to \u201cease up\u201d on cases featuring black defendants. Why? Because he ran on a campaign of how racist the criminal justice system is. Those politics got him elected and would keep him elected. It\u2019s as simple as that. \n\nSource: The Hynes scandal was highly\npublicized. The Thompson one is based on my discussions with multiple ADAs in Brooklyn - I am a NYC based attorney. \n\n",

These hotels have condominium units which allow someone to own a full-service vacation home. When they are not using this home, they can leverage the marketing and management done by the hotel chain to rent and manage the condo unit as it would any other hotel room.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/nyc/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27",
